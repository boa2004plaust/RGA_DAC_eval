0087059,"''The Challenge of Exploring Venus'' is a informative text, Venus called the ''Evening Star''is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky,In the solar systen Venus is the secont from our sun; Earth's twin Venus is teh close planet to Earth, and occasionally the closest in distance too Earth, Venus, and Mars.

First, Venus is a hot planet, Venus has somre persent of carbon dioxide,Venus is so closer to the sumfor that reason Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in iur solar system. The temoperature is the over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere presure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet, people can't survive.

Secondly, The scientifict However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can povide only limited insight on ground conditions because about However the light cannot penetrate th eatmosphere and it's from photography an dvideography ineffective.

Lastly, The NASA is working about proyects electronics made silicon and this proyects they can send this things to visit Venus and this things starts doo do about 1800's and played a important role in the 1940's during World War ll, they can move this things fon computer.

in conclution, ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus'' is a lot investigation fron interestings scientificts, showing to the people interestings things in the space,, the scientuifics lookk Venus interesting.

00d576b,"Well in my favor I would have the Electoral College reason why is because it keeps all the votes for the presidential election and etc. And each or any electors in your state has his or her own group of electors. And the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their responsibilities are. But the Electoral College it consists or has 538 electors but the majority is to have 270 s that you can vote for the president. By the way once you have voted for the president or senate or governer etc. The system will count how many popular votes or from a vote from Congress and the qualified citizens. But my reason for the electoral college to stay is that once you have voted you can count from the system or it does it for you but if you dont want the electoral college then it will take alot longer for the votes to be process and be accumilated.

Well so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, ""The electoral college? is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostky assertins withoout much basis in reality"". And its unfair cause it has the winner take all system in each state. And they sometimes have problems getting the votes from some states and they couldn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And the story says from someones opinion ""And the arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" And once a state has voten it? counts as 1 vote.

And some people and the people from the government or like congress,senators,representatives, and more hope that one day while they are voting that the score or number of votes is not a tie. But some citizens arn't into the technology of the electoral vote or how it works. But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational.

Since the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national elction, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible? American popluation did vote in 2012's election.       ?       ?       ?    ",1
00e3edb,"The author suggets that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers if presnts because if something happens to earth if we study venus we will know some stuff to do. Like all the needs to stay alive keep breathing and is it even possible. Because if a war happens with the usa and the blow up america we will need somwhere to go. So in order for us to know all of these things we will have to study abot other planets to survive at.

Venus also looks the sefest out of all the other planets. Its shaped like earth close to earth so its in the same atmosphere so it gets the same oxygen. the shape and size is pretty similar so there should be enough romm for people. its close to the sun so we dont know if its safe . it could be safe if the un rotates away from it so people can actually live their.

Since venus is so close to the sun we will have to send someone their to se if it liveable. if we ever decided to move to venus we will have to bring so much stuff and it would take a while. so i dont think everybody will make it before us is destroyed.",1
00ef89f,"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever and here is why.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",1
01267d1,"The Face was dicovered on May 24, 2001. It was discovered by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.

But many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look. On paragraph ten, the text states, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" On paragraph twelve, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" So, the Face that they found on Mars was just a natural landform after all.

Using evidences from the texts, we learned that the Face was discovered on May 24, 2001. We learned that many people believed it to be an alien monument, but it was not. The Face got looked a second time, on April 8, 2001, but with the camera's absolute ""maximum resolution."" In the end, they found out that the Face was just a natural landform and not an alien monument.           ",1
014eba6,"As I know from images and researches that aliens could possibly exist by the looks of it . Not so Postive about it , but why would there be an human face on mars when people aren't on Mars everyday of there lives. Also that by seeing pictures of hwo aliens look there similar too us in a way , but the mouth is weird shping like it's not a human mouth that people think it may be . Makes you have second thoughts and makes you want to investigate more on the "" The Face On Mars "" . Each year we have something new on this face of mars.

So we investigate more on these pictures to see exactly what were trying to find out because it doesn't add up how would I big hu,man face be on mars. doesn't make since too me. Yeah and like "" Garvin "" says we don't pass over a human face very often so something isn't right here. The scientist put there all into this to figure out what there dealing with.

So finally in 2001 we've came to an conclusion and find out from all our investigations that it's really just a ' mesa ' It's an Middle Butte in the Snakwe River Plain of Idaho It's the same height of as "" Face on Mars "".",1
0156ea6,"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours.

It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure.

So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere.",1
01bb061,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage . There are 3 important sources that tell us why people should limit car usage . Source 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars. Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog . Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Last but not least ,Source 4 : The end of car culture .

To begin with , In sources 1 & 2 you can tie in the two sources to conclude that limiting car usage is going on in Germany and Paris. Most people walk , ride bikes, or catch the train. Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to put them in large garages at the edge of the development , where a car - owner buys a space for 40,000 along with a home ( 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars para 2 ). Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of global cities. ( Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog para 10 ). Diesel was blamed , since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline .

As well in sources 3 & 4 Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota and cars have come to an end with culture. They feel as though when people ride bikes , and trains it can prevent car jams. ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 20 ).The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. In ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 35 ). shows that for example van services can share services to have less cars and less gasoline . They also have a bike sharing company that you can share bikes and dont even need to use a vehicle.

In Conclusion , There are advantages in limiting the use of cars. With 3 helpful Sources

Source 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars. Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog . Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Last but not least ,Source 4 : The end of car culture prove the advanges of limiting cars.    ",1

Venus is one of the closet planet to the Earth in terms of density and size but the orbits with the sun of the both planets are completly different, the missions that the spacecraft do not survive, is more challeging with the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, on the surface of the planet can arrive temperatures of eight houndred degrees Fahrenheit, but also they have many metals and gases that can be good for our in different ways and also the curiosity of the of how can take that resources, the NASA is working in try to study that planet with electronic made of silicon that are tested with chaos of Venu's surface.

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was? the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also? voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. This is all I wanted to tell you , I hope you listen to what I'm trying to tell you. I know I am not the only one that thinks like this. If you would like to contact me back you could email me at EMAIL_ADDRESS. Thankyou and have a great day!

0279487,"When cars where made by humans they put this device that is to have the car be more alarmed to the driver and everyone else that is in the car, but there are still some cars that are very old and don't have the same menufactors that are placed in the old cars that are like 1800s and 1900s. I think that the old cars should be put into some car meuseum or somthing to remind us how the very first engine car ever work without having a carage that has to have a horse to use as wheels even though that was a very very very very very very long time before even engine cars even excisted in time.

i think that we've impoved on the safety of everyone that is driving and that are still learning to drive and trying our hardest to keep people safe from harm but useally that doesn't happen, we would have some difficulties with the cars that we are using today still needs some work to be done with them. I think it's a good idea to put more control on the car and less for the driver that has to drive the car. The only reason why we build cars and buses and trains and etc is to make us get to things like a if your running late for something and you need to get there really fast you could take your car and get there as fast as you can so your not offically late and not get fired and have to lose your job cause you were late for work.

That's why we have cars to rely on and not our feet the whole time but most times if we dont want to use our car we can always walk there thats somewhere close and not far to walk like the gas station or the park or anything or if your just to dang ""LAZY"" to even walk that far then you would use a car or if you dont own a car you always use the bus to go where you want to go. It's not that hard to spend a little money on a bus toll to get to where you want to go and really it's not that hard at all but if it's for something really important then ""GO BUY A CAR"" i mean yeah cars are exspenive to even afford one but really if you save money then wouldn't have no problem at all on buying a car that has to fit your needs and get to places that you need to go.",1

this evidence i got it from the article saying that thieir having technology where you can tell what people are feeling inside of them or if their mad at you or other stuff so its really cool that they invented this technology cause now people can see peoples emotions and we could never do that.

First, the person who made this software was Prof. Thomas Huang, the Beckman institute fro Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who started to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The first subject he wanted to do was Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Your maybe thinking how do u use a software just to find out how someone is feeling well...

In fact, the computer takes the model of the picture or what ever is there,but it must have human muscles in the picture ir 3-D model the human muscles is called ""acton unit"". It only takes in the model if it see's it have forty-four major muscles like a human would have. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman has classified for the software to have six emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness.

Street parkings and driveways are forbidden in the new district near the French and swiss borders. the streets are completely empty except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community. In addition, 70% of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. A growing trend going around they say they want to seperate them from auto use, a saying called ""smart planning"". the efforts that they put in that some people build their own houses to reduce greenhouse? gas emissions from tailpipes. In Europe they are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United states.

In conclusion, there have been effortsain the past two decades to make the cities more dense, and better for walking. Home to 5,500 residents within a square mile, this may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. above all this, stores are placed on about a walk away, on a main street rather then along some distant highway. According to them how much you drive is as important as weather you have a hybrid. Suburbs will spread out the homes were thwe dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. in the developing world where they will increase number of private cars ownd by the middle class. In the United states, the enviromental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legistlators are starting to act cautiously. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role.

The cold air and warm days would cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Deisels make up to 67% of vehicles in france, campared to 53.3% rest of Western Europe, according to reuters. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. paris had 147 per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, reuters found.

Radar was a device on a hilitop that cost two hundred miliion dollars. It was not something you could buy at radio shake So just how driverless will the cars be in the near future? Sensers are nothing new, of course. In the 1950's automakers used speed sensors at the whells in the creation of antilock brakes Within 10 years, Those sensprs had become more advanxced to detect and respong to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheel and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone Fuyrther improvemenrts in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more druvung takse on theri own.

060a4e7,"In the passage the Author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents. In the first paragraph the author says ：Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.：. In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. Another quote from paragraph one is ：However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun：. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. In paragraph two it says ：Often referred to as Earths ：twin：, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth：. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. In the passage in paragraph three it says ：A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus：. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it. My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way.",1

I think that the Electoral College is important becase it is? a process. The founding fathers established the Eletoral College to the Constitution as a comromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualificatied citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors.

The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. The counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. The mjority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District? of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ''state'' also refers to the District of Columbia.

The presidential elction is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in

November. One thing that I didn't know is that most states have a ""winner-take-all.""A ""winner-take-all"" is a system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate.    ",1

I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president. If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal. If you have a solid regional favorite you go for them states first then you work around to different states to get more Electoral votes but then if you leave that state that was with you all the way then they atomatically switch to the other person that has been campaigning around all the other states and takes your states what are you supposed to do then? The only thing you can do is just go back and try to get your state back..

One way is

Electoral College,

Electoral college is a process consisted of thye selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the votes from congress. So if you think about it we are just electors for electors. This College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes can win the election for the President.

Under the Electoral college, voters dont vote for the president, they vote for state electors who in turn elect the president. There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. People want to have their vocies hear for the country they live in, they want an opinion that matters! You can't have that when someone else is speaking for you...    ",1

In htis essay i will talkin about the challenging of exploring venus , by the end the understanding and the point of view will be changed.

In this first paragraph I will further give extended details and further elaborate on what venus is. Venus is the second p[lanet from our sun . Venus is easy to see at nighy only because how bright it is and how it stands out. but you will hardly ever get to see it closely you will more than likely see it better from a distance and that's what makes it so difficult and challenging and what makes the oppurtunity for me to be able to further explain why it is challenging . Venus is also the closets planet to earth in size and density. According to the article it says ""often referred to as earths twin venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size"".

""How is yours better than mine we both do the same thing. Can't we just put this feud to an end?"" I asked.

"" No, people don't listen to him or let him convince you to join his program, instead join mine.""He protested.

0ada1e2,"Dear, Florida Senators

I believe that the Electoral College is a good way of voting for a President and Vice President because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by? a single vote in Congress. The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there President and Vice President. Plus the majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President of the United States. The United States entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One each of the memebers in the House of Representives plus two of your Senators. In our state, each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a President and Vice President of there chose. Some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for President or Vice President. Our state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. '

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If I lived in Texas, for example, and wanted to vote for [Adam] Pis , I'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Pis. On the note, that those electors won the statewide election, they would goto congress and Pis would get 34 electoral votes. There are a lot of questions that people ask, who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so, it must depends what state the citizen lives in.

Perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Its hard to think about this but some are right, abolish the electoral college!

Street parking and driveways are fobidden in some districts. Germans can buy a large garage that cost $40,000 along with the home. 70% of Vauban's famileis don't own cars and 57% sold their cars to move into that distric.

On monday motorists with even numbers had to leave their vichle at home if they refused they had to pay 22-euro fine ($31).Almost 4,000 drivers were fined by the international agency headquartered in London.

0b8588b,"I'm wanting to keep the Electoral College because it comes in handy in our system for voting. They can help us break a tie between two competing candidates that want to become presidents of the United States. You may not think its a big deal but it is. I don't like the ""winner-take-all"" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. Now back on to the subject, the Electoral College can be important to the system. The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus.    ?    ",1

In paragraph two im going talk about the negative effects on the situation. For our third body paragrapgh i'll be introducing the

Cofounder Sergey Brin says that he foresees that we'd use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility then a bus. In 2013, BMW announced that these driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020! The cars that Google has had since 2009 have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. They alert drivers when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

One negative question I have for these driverless cars is, ""Whats the point of having these cars if you still need a driver""? New laws will be needed in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident. ""If technology fails and someone gets injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer? This requires human skills which means humans have to be alert at all time in case of emergency. These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads.

""In 1980's automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. These sensors are in need of improvements so that these driverless cars can be capable to handle more of the driving task that can lead to dangerous accidents. The 1980 cars had become more advanced to detect respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. IN the end these cars just need a lot of sensors so they can sense when things are about to occur.

Today i've talked about three different preview points. In the first body paragraph I talked about the positive upside of the driverless cars. In the second paragraph I had a dicussion about negative effects on driverless cars. With my third body paragraph I ended with talking about smarter cars and their sensors.

i think mona lisa demostration is really intented to bring a smile to another person is smile, while it shows just much a computer can do imagine a computer that knows when you are sad, for example if you smile when a web ad appers on your screen, a similar and might follow,

I think the same technology can make computer animated facer or more expressive for example like video games or video surgery, and most human communication is nonvebal, includind like emotional communication.

Maybe the phone can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lsa's smile. ",1
0e8c167,"Dear Senator,

Do you really think the electoral college should stay? The second source states that Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Does that make any sence to you? That even though the majority votes on one thing but they dont get that in a democracy?

The electoral college is just a waste of time. Why would i want to do what the second source says and vote for a guy to vote for who i want to vote for? Reald that sentence again. Makes absolutely no sence.

The only part that makes sence is that no matter how large of an area or the bias of an area, the electoral college can not be bias.

I think we should not have the electoral college. Mostly because i dont think i want to learn about swing states and run off elections and stuff.

Thanks for the consideration,

Just think how much money they save for not paying for gas,car payments and parking places,plus if you dont have a car its always good to ride a bike or walk somewhere. And 75% sold there car just to move here. Its easier for citys to walk and drive around somewhere. Its easy now to get where you need to go if you walk because they made stores close by so you can walk to them.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. If you had a even or odd license plate one day you werent aloud to drive that day you had to wait. But some people did not follow this rule about 4,000 drivers were fined. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after having some of the people not drive and after five days of intensifying smog. Cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap in car emissions. What they are doing is really good because this could help people not drive as much.

Bogota,Colombia people hiked,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car free day. It was the third straight year cars have been banned. Only buses and taxis were allowed for work and transportation. Even when it had rained they didnt care they still kept walking. Parks,Sport centers and shopping stores have gotten alot better because of the people walking. For a very first time Colombian cities ,Cali and Valledupar joined this event too.1990's is when they started a day without cars in Bogota.

Trying to make less people drive now a days. President Obama's goals is to curb the united states greenhouse gas,it says americans are buying fewer cars ,fewer licenses and driving each year. The kids now a days dont really care about driving too much or care to even get a license. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent bewtween 2001 and 2009.

I believe that you should stick with the electoral college, because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you.

I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it.

I also don't care to much for government. But if i did i would try to read the whole passage and give you a really good essay to read. But i don't and im not that sorry either and don't care. If your really want somones opinion you should ask someone who doesn't care ask one that does because then you would get a good answer but not from me.

Also next time you want to give me a passage don't give me one on the government. Because frankly no one im my grade will care because I certeny do not. But thats just my opinion. And i know that repeating things in an essay is bad but really, you need to give this passage to someone that care thats not me. And no one reallt cares about the fiasco in 2000 or any other year for that matter and you can't make them. Also if someone says that can't wright on a spicific topic belive them and try to change it please and thank you.

Ooh and if whoever is reading this or if your grading this be remind ed if this was getermining if I were to get out of entsive reading or not for next year i really wouyld try harder.

Its so dangerous that a spacecaft hasn't landed on Venus in over 30 decades.

Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditios by staying up and out of their way.

At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees, but the iar pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable.

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life.

Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.

Astronomers fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

Venusiam geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

It is one of the brightest points in the sky because it looks like a star, although it is considered a planet. It is also the second planet from are sun in our solar system. The nickname ""Evening Star"" is misleading since it is actually a planet.

It is often considered to be Earth's twin becaise it, in terms, has the same terms of density and size and is occasionally the closest planet in distance. Since Venus is right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planets cloud draped world. Each of the previous missions were unmanned, and that was for a good reason, since no spacecraft could survive for more than a few hours there.

Most of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. What is even more challenging is the cloud that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid, which are also located in the atmosphere. The temperature let alone would kill a person right on contact. The temperature is 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than what we have ever experienced on are planet.

I am writting this letter on behaf of my feelings on changing the election by popular vote.

The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)

""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.

Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality

We all are here today to right a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college, or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states.

It consists of 538 electors 270 elector votes is requiredto elect the president.

So? witch one do I think is the best. I agree to keep the Elector College because things are running ok for now but it think the the people of the United States should have a little more say so in the disitions made in america because we are the american peopele and we have the right to speak are mind, and if we dont think somthing is a good idea we should be able to tell the congrees we dont belive in that and choice somthing eles that more people agree on. The only thing i see wrong with every one getting to have a say so is that not every one agrees with one another.

I do agree that a bigger population shold get more elector votes but i dont thing it i far but it is what it is and i dont have a say so im ok with it. the only thing i have to say is its not right that the bigger populated states get the most etention they are the most important but i dont feel its right all states should be equal no mater there population size.

I dont think that they shold change the Election of popularity because instead of voting for the right thing we could just vote for the presedent that is offering the best stuff, and when presedents promise us stuff it dosent alwasy men there going to keep that promise. they keep promises to every one and they cant keep a promise to one person with out breaking that promis to another person. like i sai i think the elector college should just stay the same way as it is with thoughs little changes because it is working. but things stop working at some point and when that time comes we will need a new system.       ?       ?

For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.

They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. So based on what i put down on this final draft my claim is that this kind of technology is valuable.",1
126187d,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technoloy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl.  ",1
127dd08,"Some new computer softwar that recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation from prof. New techology experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. But each expression is compared against a neutral face. But the computers can identify human emotions like happy, fearful, angry and sad.

The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. To faces more expressive the can tell how the person feel sad, angey and happy. Also the video the people can play with friend in school or in online. When student are bored they can play video game and make their happy. The hospital use technology for video surgy. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. so computer need to understand that, too.

imagine a computer that knows when you happpy or sad. Technology can make thing better but some technology can make thing worse.      ",1
129237b,"The aurthor of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" said in paragraph 1, they point out that Venus is sometimes calle the ""Evening Star"" because it is one of the brightest points of light in the nigth sky. Some people mistaken the names beacuse Venus is actually a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun.

In paragraph 2 it says that Venus is considered Earth's ""twin"". They say that because they are simlar in shape and size. The one of the differences they have is speed. In paragraph 2 it also states that, ""because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

In paragrap 3 it says that, Venus has a thick atmoshpere of almost 97 persent and the layers are considered blankets. The clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The temperatures range up to 800 degrees fahrenhiet. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. The pressure from that would crush a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest partof the ocean.

In paragraph 4 that they don't quite understand why they are studing ""our sister planet"". The aurthor states that the planet Venus is ""inhospitable"" and he/she want to know why Scientists are even discussing going back. The aurthor also state in paragraph 4 that they don't understand why Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because the author think the reason is that because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. They also state in pararaph 4 that they think that Venus was once ""covered largely with oceans"". That it couldv'e supported various forms of life like Earth does. They state that Venus has some features that life couldv'e been on it.

In paragraph 5, it says that NASA is thinking about sending human to Venus. They have invented a spacecraft that can travel on the fray on the outside of Venus. They think that it will work so it avoyeds all the storms and other conditions that is happening on the planet. They say that the temperature wil still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit.

I get that theres going to be fights and drama but still the people has to have the rigth to vote for who they want. I would like to vote too but not for someone to get to pick whatever president he wants. Think of the people, what if you were the people and you wanted to pick your self as president but the congress picks another president just because hes close to winning like you. Were in the United States a place of freedom so let the people vote and let them be free.

I think that the

Electoral college should omly have one elector. Why? because there will be less fights and arguments it will be all up to one elector to pick a president plus all the people that voted. I think it should be a llitle diffrent the elector should vote like a regular person but hes vote costs 500 votes so it will be half fair and helps the president he wants a little. The bad things are that people wouldn't think it's fair and the elector will have alot of pressure. The good things is that there wont be arguments or fights and thats what its all about.       ?

By the way, did making a happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happy? According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. (＾Putting on a happy face￣ actually works!)

154607a,"The claim that the author supports the idea that studing Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers because they maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. The dangers and pursuit are higly high risks for people and NASA.It is dangers because Venus is the secound planet from our sun and the atmosphere in Venus is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. Even more challenging is that the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the plant surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. The despite to go Venus is that they are hoping to look for something their because the plant has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. Somethings that we some how have they call Venus Earths sister. That why I think it so despite that NASA wants to see what else Venus got that the plants sister does not have.

An explanation of the article that supports my claims are when the author says this ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Also when they said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""Venus is also dangers for people because it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""Beyond high pressure and heat,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

My conclusion to the authors writting is that they will not end up sending people to Venus because its to risky. They will end up sending newer technoligi up their so that they could see what the sister of Earth got. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth -like planet in our solar system. Venus is most likely the most compared planet to Earth.

It was able to read six emotions hapiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness due to their 44 major strands of muscles on a humans face.

The way that FACS was able to read your emotions are like complicated math equations. The 44 strands each have different meanings each movement of one or more muscles are called ""action unit"". The frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyebrows) raises your eyebrows when your surprised and your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. The use of FACS have been use on the Renaissance Painting Mona Lisa by Leonardo da vinci to show expressions that only that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery.

In my family its important to learn and get youst to doing thatbecause my famoly dose alot of edventering. We go to the D.R, Hawaii Colorado, and alot more places too.

I still kow my beat friens name in the D.R. We taught eachother how t say the alfabet in English and Spanish.

Just saying I had the best time of my life and I stayed in the same place the hole time and I still lernd a lot in one day.

And the hole time I was there I was so happy till it came to the part when I had to say by to all my new good friend that I made there. Its hard to leave but then you get to all the other places and meet other people there too.

People that want to explor should do this in order to see what ist like and if thay want to do this for the a long time or not.

secientists can make a blimp like vehicle so it can hovering over the roiling landsacpe the conditilons of the planet it wll not be survivable for humans .

they can use a ship to see venus far above the plant so they do not have to send humans in to to the survivable part of venus lf they send a vehicle in venus the vehicle can not

send photography or any video back to the secientists becuase the unhavetbe conditilons.

lf they use a mechanical computer they ware use back in 1940 during world ll the computer can run with no elerctronis at all most modern computer are powerful to today the mechanical computer only use gears and levers and do not have tpo have enteteny

lf we have one of the project done we can make are way to venus    ",1
18f8ef2,"Discussing the face on Mars. Well the face on mars is fasinating picture that the spacecraft took. People say it looks like a face, and that it was created by Aliens, but it really didn't. What really happen is that its called a Martian mesa, and that it's common around Cydonia, only that there was a very unusual shadows that had people thinking that it's a face. And if it was really why can't man go on that planet to see if its a real face. It's because it not real and they just want people to think it's real by having it on Hollywood films and other movies. The government would have never allow this important information out to everybody because the world would go crazy that their is a new planet, and aliens are on that planet. it would have people thinking such as if they were gonna try to attack us and crazy stuff like that.

Another fact about this is on April 5, 1998 Mars Globbal surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped pictures of the intresting planet to see what was there. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team revealed that there were no aliens monument after all. And that's why the Face of Mars isn't what they say it is.",1
191f567,"The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" is a really intresting passage. In the text states, that ""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars"". This shows, that if they have to go somewhere they go walking. Also the street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbiden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg.

However, In Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free""-except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and few streets on one of the edge of the community. But car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park, and is for $40,000, along with a house. And as a result , 70% of Vauban's families do not onw cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. Because when she had a car she was always tense. Also cars causes lazyness to do stuff, and it doesn't keep you healthty. For example, when you walk you stregh your body and and all the parts of your body are moving. But when you use car you sit down and sometimes that can cause a back problem.

Forthere more, all of our development since World War II has been centerd on the car, and that has to change. In Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with? spread-out homes and private garages, were the drea towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appel. This means, that back then spread-out homes and private garages where the dream towns. In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities are staring to act, caustiously.

Indeed, many experts escept public transporter serving suburbs to play much larger role in a new six year federal transpotation bills to be approved this year. Also in previous bills, 80% have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This means that having a car is a really waste of money but its also important to have a car.    ",1

Like how residents from Germany upscale community are suburban pioneers and they have given up their car's. Street parkng, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in there district. Why is this forbidden? i just don't get it. Car owners buy there own space, for $40,000 along with there home. In Europe passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new federal. So fellow citizens should help them out with there limiting car usage. they sure have a lot going on. Like in the end of car culture. There expanses and suburban ideals had long been one of the world's prime car ciltures. But American's love affatr with its vehicles seems to be cooling. Its seens like they don't mind.

If i was a big huge fellow citizen i would help out with what there going throuh because i don't think this is right. For them to be having to pay so much more then what we have to pay is not cool. What would we do without car's we can't walk everywhere. That wouldnt be right. They say te day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s.

What about if it was raining how are we suppsoed to get to work or get food. we need a car to get to places. They say the rain hasn't stopped people from participating. But i think it has stopped them. Therefore we need are cars to get to where we need to be. ?    ",1

NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2, then it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras on Viking 1. These photos were taken from the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

Viking 1 took a picture of something call a butte or mesa. They're most common in the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. Their is one in the Snake RIver Plain in Idaho.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 rimes larger than the pixel size. If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" said Jim Garvin.

19fcf9f,"I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people . But then again you have some conflicts with the environment getting all ugly and nasty . Some people are different from others not everyone will want to go the same way meaning . They rather have their own privacy and not be on a bus or a train full of random people that might be sick with a flu or smell really nasty. Thats why 80 percent of transportation has been thruogh highways an only 20 percent to other transportation . Most of the people who intend to use train or buses don't have the right amount of money to purchase a brand new car or even a used one . The cause of that is Taxes or IRS are taking to much from the people who work to hard an theres nothing that can be done too that.

This is what I don't get about how things are being done to try an save our planet called earth . If you want to try an save some thing an make it better. Don't make a expensive invention an expect people to by it like for examlpe the hybrids or plug-in cars. People can't afford many things in life because money comes an goes without out you evening knowing it . So why try to start something new when its only making more of a mess that inventers are cuasing.

The way Bogota is going is the best idea that I've ever heard of they couldn't of nailed it any better . They stopped a capital city of 7 millon people from using their cars . An look at the good effects it did, new restaurants where opened an upscale shopping district haved cropped up .? The pitted an uneven sidewalks have been fixed an replaced by new smooth sidwalks. Even parks and sports centers haved also bloomed throughout the city, which is good because parents have more time an money to get their kids more actived in to sports an going out to play.

The last passage explanes what I've been saying less people are buying cars why invent new things . People are going unemployedment an things aren't going to get any better for our country . The governments are asking for to much plus you have taxes an the IRS right behind them waiting to grab your money that you worked hard for . Another thing that I don't get is why the President of the untied states can help other countries but yet can't even of seem to help his own country who is lossing more money as days go by .

1a651c3,"venus in one of the brightesrt points of light in the nigt sky, this nickname is misleading

since venus is actually a planet, venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. numerous factors contribute to venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of highly carrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere . on the planet superface, temperatures average over 800 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaer than what we experince on our own planet in ine condition for everyone than humans.

the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus . the nasa is working on other approaches to studying for example venus study the surfaceand have lasted for there weeeks in such conddition, by comparation, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Do to to our current limit in technology and the harsh ecosystem on Venus, it is is extremely hard for us to find out any information about this planet. Many people wonder why scientist still try to find out more information about Venus. The reason is that Venus's ecosystem could have been similar to ours many years ago. Since the planet shows signs of mountains, valleys and craters we can safley assume their was once an ocean on the now uninhabitable planet. Many scientist believe that we can safley hover above Venus's atomsphere to get a better look at it. However other scientist state that they want to go on to the planet to take samples of rock, gas ect. Either way going to Venus will not be happening anytime soon. ",1

1b7e42c,"Alien Landform?

Do you think that the face on Mars is real or was created by an alien? As being a scientist, I dont think the face is real because Mars is not a living planet. Many of the planets in the solar system have different types of landforms in general. There is alot of evidence on how it could be many things and how it could have been made. Down below will be some evidence on how I think that the face on Mars is not real.

First, in paragraph two it said that the ""Face"" looks like a human face. ""An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Carpet Planet called Cydonia."" This could have meant that the camera was just put where the ""Face"" may have been looking at directly. there are many ways how this could just be a huge rock at a certain angle being a ""Face"".

Secondly, in paragraph 7 it states another thing about the type of landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . .a natural landform."" This states that there was no alien monument after all. That was another thing about how the ""face"" could have been a natural landform like how any other planet has.

Next, we all know how many people read magazines and watch movies. In paragraph 5 it states that the ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. 'It has started in a Hollywood film, apperared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" The defenders of the NASA budget wsh there was an ancient civilization on Mars. People were saying that NASA was trying to cover something up. Maybe some people dont think that its true so and that they need more information to let people know after they have found alot of information.

Now, their is a possibility that there is aliens on Mars. In paragraph 8 it claims, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face but perhaps they were alien markings that werre hidden by haze. ""It could have just been the camera that was not capturing them right. it also states how they dont pass over the face very often as in they are thinking that the ""Face"" might move like aliens. But, there is not enough evidence that this is a natural landform or an alien face. It even states how it could even be a lava dome that took form on the isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars that was on another planet.

In conclusion, I don't think that the aliens are real. I won't think that until they have an extradanary amount of evidence stating that is is a face. NASA has made alot of mistakes in the past and maybe this is one of those mistakes.             ",1

He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.

He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean.

Venus also neighbors other planets an example is in paragraph 2 ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These diferences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to Venus. because Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

Venus has surface temperatures that are up to ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the atmosphere is ""90%"" stronger than what we experience on earth. Venus also makes up ""97% of carbon dioxide"" so we would not be able to breath with also the planet being to hot to step on. they have also had unmanned missions on Venus for example in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

1e1d55f,"Dear Florida Senator,

Would you like to vote, or do you feel obligated to vote? I personally want my vote to make a difference. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it expess others to vote and to have freedom of speech of knowing which candidate would be better to control our world of which we live in.? If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election.

First of all, voting is all about the candidates, try to understand and know the candidates before voting. ""Voters sometimes get confused about the elctors and vote for the wrong candidate."" If you didn't know the candidates and voted the wrong candidate, then your vote may make a difference and you would have to wait patiently for four years intill your able to vote again for a different candidate.

Secondly, If you don't want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference, then I'm sure others feel the same way. ""A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does."" Every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state, and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions.

Thirdly, Candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and sercure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house. ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" It's great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count.

In conclusion, we cannot control electors who wants to vote for a candidate that others may dissagree on, but we can control our own vote.

It's your decision whether to vote or not and who do you approve for. Your vote can make a difference and every bit counts. So there is a reason to have the Electoral College.    ?    ",1

This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a lot more than an advemture for Luke. In paragraph 9 he quotes, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""",1
22312c6,"This article talks about an image being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. A new software ha sbeen develloped that improves accuracy in perciving the emotions of others. this new software, the Facial Action Coding Syste, has promising applications for variety of industries.

This technology can recognize emotions like the Leonardos da Vinci's renissance painting, Mona Lisa, she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe. The process beings when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model

of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The facial expressionsfor each empotion are universal. By weighting the different units, the softwere can even identify mixed emotions. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For intance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of, course most of us woulld have trouble actually describing each facial tarit. While it shows just how much this computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. Acordinng to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion I think that this new technology would be beneficient for the people because it would help to know better the people. Also to know about those muscular action units. ",1

There are five reasons to keep the electoral college, but there is many reasons to get rid of it for good. i know most peole or adults that really vote and our into politics would say otherwise but i beleive that we should get rid of it and really let the people have a voice and not have a group of people speack for us. When i was little they used to tell me that you learn something new evertyday and they were righty i leaen morwe and more everydsy that the electoral cvollege is unconsitional in my eyes why have a group ogf peopole speack for us we have avoice we can do it o our own we need to get rid ofg the electo5ral college for good. So that the peoplew of the

United States of America have a say so in who we choose to run our country.

NASA scientist dont believe that this was alien trying to send a signal or a message to us for all we know a astroid may hit mars and we didnt know.

On the flip side people and scientis have belived and wondered if aliens are real and there is many cases to make people believe there are alien living amungst human along with movies, games, and toys. We are all fasinated by space and still think aliens are real and some think that aliens are not real.

23709d9,"electrol college is not just a college it is a process,? The electoral college is a process that consist of the selection of the electors,? it started in the founding fathers established in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president . this means that the electorol college should stay this college is more than just any old college its history ,its in the constitution this college should not be gone this college should be honored. these electorals mainly select the votes for the people in the white house like the president and vice predident. our state is entitled allotment of electors equals the nuimber of memebers in the congressional delegation? . i want electoral college to stay because they are good at things for the state . and they also have a big role in alot of things.

the electors college plays a big role in our state . under the 23 amendment of the constitution , the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and a treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college . this means that because of the electoral college the district of columbia is treated like a state . so electoral college? is the reason why some districts are called a state why take this type of college away if this has such a big role in alot of things to do with the congress . with out the electoral college they wouldnt have presidents or any thing . in every election the electors are always there in every president election every president have their own group of electors behind them . they are joined by a canidates political party .

u may wonder how the electors work because all u do is see them behind the prsident well the process is hard and they want students who wants to be an elector to get ready on what they are about to get in to . it first start off by the u choosing the president when u choose the president u choose the group of electors this means when you choose the president the electors goes with him or her , most states have winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winng pesidental canidate's electors . after the election the govoner pepares a 'certificae of ascertainment'. this means that that it is listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with names of their respective electors . the electors go through a long process . and the college wants the studentsa to know all the things they need to before they become electors.

the electors deserve to have a college someone might want to be an elector and they might think its hard for them it wouldnt be anything with out electors they do more than just stand behind the president they do more they help the president the president we have today wouldnt be able to run for president without a group of electors . and they need a college for someone who wants to be an elector. this college should be honored to be in a program like that these electors are needed in our country with out electors we would have nothing if we didnt have electors the electoral college is widely know as an non democratic method of selecting a president that outa be by declaring the canidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner .

these are all the reasons why we need the electors program . because they play in a big role of our country and dthey also good for our state and .l so we need these progems to show young student that being an elector is not easy itbis very hard and a long process and we need to show students how the experience is and they also need to be knowleged trained to do stuff that will make our country better . because if they mess up? on one little thing its an automatic fire for them . we need these colleges because it plays a big role and it reuires the votes. of the president meaining it helps the president win .       ?       ????????       ?       ?       ?

247f18e,"I think that the development should happen because it can be easier to drive. Also i think it can prevent less accidents and save lives. For example, sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individial wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could ever manage alone.

Also, the development should happen because it can be very hepful. For example, In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.

My last reason to have the development is sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their on. Also antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take us take us wherever we desire.",1

mars globe surveyspace craft revealed the face of mars is a mesa (intro) ,scientists found it was just another martian mesa(2).

A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ＾huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.￣ The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars(3).

on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.(7)

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001！a cloudless summer day in Cydonia！Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ＾We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,￣ said Garvin. ＾Malin¨s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera¨s absolute maximum resolution.￣ Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo(10).

why i think that we should keep it how it is because is concissed of it concissed of 538 electors and the majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. your state is required to allotment of the electors to equal the number od members in its Congerssional delgation. Under the 23 Amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors. each canidate running for state has the there own group of electors. Electors are genarall choosen by the politial party. you or who ever is voteing helps choose your states electors when you vote. but when you vote for your candidate you ae actually voting for you candidates electors. After the electon there is a Certificate of Ascertainment perpared by the governor listing all of the canidates who ran for President along with the hname sod their electors.

Althoe there are some reasons why the Electoral college should change. Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy.

25d7df0,"Introduction

-

If i were given a chance towork for NASA truthfully i would not take the job i don't really like science jobs like that . Anyways , i don't think that the faces were created by aliens . (Why dont i think it was created by aliens) that's a very good question first off aliens are made up creatures they are just tools to make science non fictional movies come to life . I just strongly think that aliens are made up they can't be real there is no proof to back up what everyone believes . Space doesn't have any gravity so their can't be any animals up there floating ! The mask kinda looks like clay maybe the mask is made out of clay that you can mold it into anything you want ! I know that sounds crazy but someone thinking that a alien created makes it sound even more crazier ! Lets be VERY serious The article says ""Face on Mars has been popular in magazines and talk shows"" People will believe anything these days even i know that half of the things that the media says or does is not true and i also know that they make things up for attention or too be well known . Now if i got paid as much as the talk show host i may have told some fibs from time to time !

Body - I have to remember that everybody has a opinion and everybody has a input . I am a ""Show me and i'll believe type girl"" I don't have any evidence or proof that Aliens are real and that they the mask it just doesnt fit together that's like saying pigs can fly ! There is NO proof so i can't process it i know somebody named De'Oshmonya that knows a lot about mars and space so i may have to ask her what she thinks about it im sure she will tell me everything i need to know ! It may cause a little argument tho , but thats okay we're still going to be close . This passage helped me because it taught me some things i didn't know and it prepares me for the future it does make me wonder Are aliens real ? When i go to sleep tonight i may do some research and i'll try to find some proof . I should've done research so i could have a lot of evidence to back my statement up that would've been the best thing to do .

Conclusion - Even tho i said i don't believe in aliens it does make me question alot of things . This article was written way before i was born things have changed and everything should be different now. Maybe if aliens were real they were probably alive in the ancient times and probably left when the dino's left . I just never know Ela is my favorite subject it always makes me learn new things and it helps me understand more than i knew before . Ela is very tricky and sometimes it gets confusing but in the end it helps you and expands your knowladge to the finer things in life . I hope that you got the correct answers out of my paragraph hopefully i can come back next year and be prepared to tell everyone about my research !!!",1

Other thing is that people saying bad things to mona lisa that why she invited a technology object that allows to see emotions. And also mona lisa says that most people have trouble describing each of their facial trait. And also she wants to see if people are always happy or anger or their sad.

They say car owner ship is allowed but there are only two places to park, large garages but that would take up to $40,000. Also, along with a home. 70% of people in the Vaubans family believe that life is better with out cars, of course they do not own cars. 57% sold a car to move here. In 2006 there was a growing trend in Europe, The United States, and else where to seperate suburban life from auto use.

Ifeel that the Electoral college is not a place its a process. The Founding fathers established it in the constitutional as a compromise between the election pf president by vote. See the elctoral college consists of 538 elctors. A majority of 270 elctoral votes is required.

To Begin,Each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. these electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political, but as usaul state laws vary on how elcetors sare selected and what thier responsibilities are....

See the presidential election is held every four years on the tueday after novemvber, but what people dont know when you vote for canidates you are actually voting for your canidate's elcetors.

Most feel its ""winner takes-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canidate; but it's states like Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proprtional representation."" After the presidential elction, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""? listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state, as well as the names of their respective electors

26aa2e8,"DEAR:

STATE SENATOR

I believe that the

Electoral College is a good thing. The way that the world has created it now is simply significant. It is like the last ray of sunshine in an empty tunnel. Don't try to get into what the others say about the way that the president should be elected. We are building the future, rock by rock, well we just picked up a brick.

The

Electoral College is not a place( even though it has ""college"", in it's name), it is a? process as stated in the 1st source . ""WHAT IS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE""?

""The

Electoral College is a process, not a place .

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a? compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". As you can see, there is no reason to change it so that the president gets his votes by poularity. It might have been good as a teenager but just remember that this is not your Highschool ""PROM"", you dont just win by fame. Being the president is hard work. If you wish to be president, dont jog for it, run for it.

Now future presidents out there just remember that you will required to have a canidate as stated in source 2 . ""THE INDENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:WHY EVEN THE BEST-LAID DEFENSES OF THE SYSTEM ARE WRONG""

? ""The electoral college requires a preisdental candidt to have trns-region appeal. No region(South, Northeast,etc.)has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romeney was in the South, has no incentive to campain heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result becaus a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"". This shows that in order to be an amazing president you need a canidate.

I am in keeping things the way that we have it now. IT is like? why find a needle in a haystack, whe you could buy one and not go through all off that pain.

So just do not waste your own time on something that do not need to be done. It like why buy a lighter, when you have a perfectly well conditioned box of matches in your house. So dont go 18 century go 21 century.

Also, Venys us the closest planet to Earth. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms and human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world for good reasons.

A thick atmosphere of aklmost 97% percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degree. it's the hottest degree. So these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.It's colser than people.

First of all, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president.

Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascetainnent. listing all of the presidents who ran for president. after the presidental election is heild every four years on a tusedayafter the first monday in vovember. you help chose your states electors.

Furthormore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged . On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh yea and senitor under the eletoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president .

Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidental party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirerly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not winthe nactional popular vote.

So Mr. senator sir im only asking you this one thing if u coud just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. pleez thats all im asking from you to? do for me just one thing. quite sime thing to do right ..    ",1
27e155e,"In the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" there are a lot of good reasons to explore Venus it is known as Earth's ""twin"". Venus in particular it stands out in the article it said ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds"" venus is the closest planet to earth yet they both travel and both have different speeds. Furthermore venus has never actually be seem up close or touched before as in human contact ""A single spaceship has not touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". Venus has a lot higher pressure and conditions then earth "" clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" and ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. But it is going to be a challenge to do studies on Venus but NASA is considering

to send a human to study Venus or Researchers are working on innovating a machine that would last long enough to study Venus. They find it facinating

because Venus has quite a few similarities to Earth "" Venus still has some fetures that are analogous to those on earth"" as in ""Planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar fetures such as valleys, mountains, and craters"".

The Nasa is working on other approches that could help out in studing venus for example some simplified elctoncs made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos venus's surface and lasting for three weeks in such a condition. They are also looking into using old technology called mechanicl computers these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and payed an important role durning ww ll.

The author is trying to say that if we continue our studying on venus and if we land more spaceships on venus we might be able to find out if oe day we could live there or if one day we could send men and women up there to find out if there was some sort of life forms and if the planet once held many differnet stuff that we didnt know that existed.

The author also informed us, readers that venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system. astronomers are also discussing if venus could in habit more life forms if they figure out what could be worn or if life forms could live on venus.

287ed5e,"I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president because i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. We have each candidate running for president in our state and it has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate political party.

I agree that most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors.

I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college.

I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College.    ",1

imaginate if the computer know when your happy or sad, that well be so cool, then you know if someone is sad and you can help him or you can know if this person is happy and he make you happy two, the can be great to create new stuff like videogame tv show and all kinda things, most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotionalcomunication, so that mean the computers have to understand that too, sometimes not only moving your facial muscles make make you express your emotion but that maybe make you feel them,making that can reveal sabout the science of the emotions.",1

On which I should pick that it's okay to have these type of cars or that we shouldn't have these kind of cars. So let's get started.

This passage is going to be based on my decion about picking or not picking the cars. I think my answer to that would be NO I don't think we should have the Driverless Cars. I think that because the whole point or should i say the whole reason why everyone wanted to be able to have there own car an be able to drive by there selfs. I don't think that people want a smart car . The smart car i would use for like old an blind people.

So that is my argument that we should not have smart cars.",1

I think that the face reconizing computer would be very reliable; because in the text its says "" A class room computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"". And if the students is ""confused and bored"" then the students is not really learning anything, beacuse all children can't be taught the same way. Some children have trouble learning or its harder for those children to learn; in a result of failing grades and low participation happening in the classroom.

In my conclusion I think that face reconizing computers would the best thing for students. In way if a students were to not understand what her/she is learning in class the face reconizing computer could realize that the child doesn't understand is and give more instructions on what to do for the topic or assingment the're doing.",2

If the car doesn't know a person is j walking it could run over the person and possibly kill them, and yes j walking is illegal but it still happens.

0066c7c,"My position on driveless cars are bad because i don't trust them. I have a couple reasons why i don't trust them. My first reason is accidents. Driveless cars could have a sytem malfunction and drive off course and something breaks and crash into somthing. This could happen to anyone such as police, buses, and simple pedestrians.

My second reason is too many driveless cars. If there were to make way too many drivless cars then it would alot of traffic because there are alot of cars who need a driver to drive. Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.

My last reason is pollution. If aot of people bought all these driveless cars then so much pollution would comeup and take over the sky and people would get sick and die from breathing in the air. If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.

That's why i say no to driveless cars.            ",2

Venus is unlikely to live on because it has 97% carbon dioixde blankets. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in acid in Venu's atmosphere.

Even though we would like to put people on Venus its just to likely that someone could die from the atmosphere.

While Venus is simple see from the distant but safe vantage poin of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Venus is not a great planet to explore. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels.""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"". This shows that Venus is not a safe planet to explore.

The scientists are been send to study Venus. The conditions on surface Venus allow scientists to float above the roiling Venusian landscape. The temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of the sea level on Earth.""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering atandard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

00a541a,"As the author tells in the article, Venus is very dangerous due to thick atmosphere of about ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide that covers venus. Not only is the atmosphere high, but the temperature and atmosphere pressure as well. The temperatures average is over eight-hundred degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is ninety times more than what humans experience on earth.

Althrough, the conditions are extreme. The author gives reasons to visit and research more about Venus. As stated, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author states that they are very amazed how Venus could have been the most similar to Earth. The author continues by describing Venus with similar Earth features, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar fetures such as valley, mountains, ans craters."" Next, the author states that Nasa is already working on making a spacecraft to last long on Venus. As said, "" For example, some simplifield electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Nasa is already planning to visit Venus for research.

Overall, the author supported his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving reasons and telling how Venus could be very similar to a Earth-like planet. ",2

How a student feel about school or a class can effect how they do in school or the class big time. If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be.

Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more.

00f3984,"The Face that is on Mars, is just a natural landform. I am here to prove that it is just a natural landform. All of my reasons will come from the passage named ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

I know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in the passage it is stated that when the spacecraft Viking 1 was circling it was snapping photos when it spotted a shawdowy figure like a human face on a region on the planet named Cydonia. After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia. Next, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor Camera snapped pictures better than the ones that Viking took. Thousands of peole waited for when the image would first appear on a JPL web site. The website revealed that it was just a natural landform after all. Finally, in the very last paragraph it said, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are similar to landforms common around the American West. A scientist named Jim Garvin said ""it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Gavin also stated ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.

So therefore, all of the reasons stated above prove that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It formed a long time ago and that is something to figure out in the future.",2

Yeah i didnt either but i completly agree with the autors point of view on this article i agree about going to venus for more information cause it would help us understand what happened to venus and if one point and time it was like earth.

The challenge of going to venus with anything is its massive air pressure, solfuric acid rain, and really hot surface temptures and we currently dont have anything to actually be able to survive those condtions for more then maybe three weeks or less so what i say we do is that we look at metals that are restiant to stuff like that and see if we could try combining the atoms to make an alloy.

In conclusion in my personal opionion i think yes we should try a little harder to get to know more about venus cause it would explain a kot and tell us if one day it was like earth and what happened to it so we could avoid it so that doesnt happen to earth and on top of that the more we learn about it the more the possiblity of it maybe becoming a hospital planet to go to if we need to ever move off of earth.

The government thinks they know whats best but what happens when people dont go threw with what they say,, we know whats best.       ?       ?    ",2
01846d8,"I think that not having cars is a good thing for these small suburban cities cause theyre only like a mile or two so its really not that far.

From what i've heard in this passage and from the sources is that its a big stress reliever and it is to help out the earth there will be less traffic jams,less pollution and more interacting with people cause face it people dont interact socailly anymore and if they do its most likely over the internet.

Another reason i think we should cut down on car use or at least car pull in vans is cause it will leave less emissions in the air and it'll hopefully help the ozone layer repair itself to its natural state

And in conclussion im all for it cause I think that it'll help people get out and get fit and there will be less crashes there be less stress from driving(roadrage/roadragers).    ",2
018fbeb,"Driverless cars are not an good idea, it would be absolutely insane.

To begin, I strongly disagree with driveless cars, because people love to be in control. For an example, a marriage relationship the husbad and the wife both think their in control or want to be.. Do you actully think that people will let go of their saftey for a car that drives on its own? Can the American citizen trust a car that on its own?

Also if the car can drive on its own what the point of a person getting their lisense. Or what about an whole sport create from driving Nascar. This would be an perfect upset for a roit. You have owners of the driving sports losing money for an driveless car that is not really safe. For an example, think about tapes and cds how they drop in production. Since poeple have ipods mp3s,itunes, and phones their no need to keep making production for music. So to bring back the driveless car could evn make the economy at drop.

To carry forward, is the nation ready for the change, theirs a prieod of time with everything. Are we sure that us humans are not jumping into things to fast.

For an example, the Model -T the nation rode on horses very long time before Ford became the new era. even with the horse they did revole many they had the invention on the light bug with the horse carriage. Putting out the driveless car can really hurt the nation maybe we should all just think about what we all are doing and see if we really do need the change.             ",2

The gravity because of in paragraph 5 the author made an example to a vehicle probably a space rover hovering above the surface. The text states that ""Just like jet airlplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms,a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions but staying up and out of there way"". Bascaily saying that the vehicle would have hard time to stay on the ground. The temperature would be as The text states in paragraph 5 ""around 170 degrees fahrenheit"". Temperatures would be scoiling hot. Air pressure would be another danger because you can only take so much pressure before you got to back to the surface. As the text states it once again in paragraph 5 "" would be close to sea level "". I do agree with the author as he says in the text ""Not easy conditions,but survivable for humans. There has been some movies about living on harsh conditions where astronauts had to live on planets with harsh conditions. So I do understand where the author is coming from that it could be possible if earth does die off and we are stuck to move to venus.

01ad79e,"Honestly, i feel very in the middle of this subject.It indeed would be nice for teachers to know when and what a stdents emotions are but,at the same time that could also be a pesonal thing. school computers should detect sadness,boredum, and or anger.On the other hand, it could be a good thing.What if the kid is very sad all day everyday?The device could send at message to the teacher so that they can talk.this could prevent a suicide and more things in that nature.

The reaon I think this is because like I said before thats not the schools buisness if im sad or happy.I wouldnt mind anyone knowing my emotions,but everyone isint me, people have different opinions and very many peopke wouldnt like that.

So I think id give my honest opinion and go with i dont know evryone isin't the same and were all human and have different opinions,characteristics ect..If it were to be in school computers i'd say you should give out a form for the sudent and or psrent to sign.Nothing like that should just be added.If this is added to school computers it Should be strongly suggested if not approved by parents.

One of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results. Another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy, and not every school could afford a machine like this. Also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read

Most students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student. Also the student could be sad, angery, or happy about something totally differant from school work, and that means it could throw the machine off.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools and never should be. Machines should never be able to read emotions.",2
01bb2f3,"Are driverless cars safe? Cars have been around for many decades and more to come. Cars are used in peoples everyday life. Cars are developing in many ways. I think driverless cars are not developed because; it's not completely driverless,It's challenging, and the car isn't advance.

Frist, driverless cars are not completely driverless. In the text it says,''this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' If the car isn't completely driverless there is no point on getting a car like this. This car can only handle driving functions up to 25mph. This mean the driver needs to keep hold of the wheels.

Secondly, the driverless car is challenging. It means it's hard to drive. Driverless cars are dangerous. It's not even driverless completely. This type of technology is sometime too advance for people. In the text it says, ''drivers have to steer,accelerate, and brake themselves.'' The driver is doing all the work.

Lastly, the driverless car isn't that advanced. In the text it say,''none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' This car tells you bthe simplest thing. In the text it says,'' it notify the driver when there's a work zone and accident.'' This car isn't really that helpful.

The driverless car isn't developed. You still should have a hand of the wheel. This is not yet completely driverless. This car tells you the simplest thing and not advanced. Why would anyone want a car that just tells you the simplest things that you can tell form just looking up at the road.",2
01c8f7a,"today i will be writing an essay on this machine called FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System it can read emotions from people in paintings and people that actually move it can tell you their emotions which i think is incredible in all but you can't just look at people's emotions without them knowing what your doing.

Most humans can already tell how our friends, family and other people are feeling just because we can look at them and tell how their feeling its as if we already knew hoow they felt just by the look on their face.

Everybody has an expression that shows how the feel each day a couple of genious's made an invention that changed the world it can tell you how a person is feeling in many different ways but they do it so everybody knows what they are feeling even though they might or might not know.

Everybody feels different emotions some might even be depressed because of maybe a loss of a family member or a best friend so might be angry because of many different things everybody have different emotions me i had depression for a long time and it took me a little bit to realize theres more to life than just sorrow or depression just move on and just try and find someone who makes me happy theres this girl that makes me happy we aren't dating but she gives me hope for the future as i said everybody is different.

So for my conclusion i think they should keep using the machine to study are feelings it may be helpful in the future so we know how to deal with it thank you for reading my essay.",2
01d0836,"The challenge of Exploring Venus is that Venus sometimes called the Evening Star because is the one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Sometimes people called the Earth twins because Venus is the cloest planet to Earth term of density and size. Between Venus and Mars is the sun because there sun goes in different speed. Venus can be a challenging because of the clouds and of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.

This shows that Venu's has a thick atmosphere of almos 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venu's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what thet experiene on our own planet. The other thing is that Ven's has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our system. Beyond the high pressure and the heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediment like erupting volcanoes, pwerful earthquakes.

Venus can be a chanllenging because in Venus it has powerful earthquakes and also erupting volcanoes it's dangerous to be there because the temperature has the hottest surface of any other planets. Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

However Venus can be ship obriting or hovering safly far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because of the most forms of the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. People cannot take samples of rock or gas or anything else from a distance. They are challenging many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to there knowledge if Venus.

Now NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. There other project is called the mechanical computers. These devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940w during World War ll. All modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick, but they are tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Venu's has been the challenge it has been a value, but not only becuase of the insight to be gained, but also that human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors. There travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited because by the dangers and doubts. It's really dangerous to be in Venu's because you never know what will happen in that planet.     ",2
01e64c4,"the author supports going to venus for further study bcause he wants to see if there might have had life on venus. He also thinks that venus might have been more like earth.

The reason why the author would want to go back to venus is to see what happend to it but the reason humans have not been back to venus in nearly 3 decades is because the rovers cant take the preassure and heat on the planet and break in 30 or less minutes.

Humans want to go so they are making prototypes of diffrent things like a blimp like vehicle that would stay 30 miles in the air that would study but the problem with tht vehicle is that no light can penetrate throw the clouds so they couldnt see anything. but they might you something called a mechinacal computer that dosnt need a battery it is operated with gears and levers so it could with stand harsh enviorments. the reason we we cant use a computer for example is because the elctronics would melt and imploud because of the emensece preassure on the surface of venus.

So the auther is for going back to venus but humans need to figure out how to get back to venus saftly and effectively so that humans ca acualy do reasarch on the planet and not just send a rover that will malfuction in 30 or less minustes and see if there was once life on venus.         ",2

First, studying Venus can be so greatful and amzing but they would be puttin a lot of things in danger just to study Venus. Venus for humans is very dangers. Like the author said in paragrag three, '' Venus has the hottest surface temerature of any planet in our soloar system.'' Despite the fact that Mercury is closer to te sun than Venus is. "" Besides the high pressure and te heat, Venus geology and weater present additional impediment like erupting volcanoes, very powerful earth quakes and frequuent ligtning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

Teacher can also see how their students are feeling on the computer but one flaw about this is that what if it didn't work. The technology would have to have many updates to get the system right and make the experiance better. Someone can hack that computer and can be watching you or the government might be trying to watch us. How much is schools going to be paying for these compter? Maybe around a million dollars in buying and fixing it. Most schools don't have good internet or they have bad students that might break these computers and the school or stduent would have to pay for it. The computers schools have now barely even work now so why buy a computer that most likely not going to work no better than the computers they already have. Why take away a ad and putting a new ad is going to make a student happy? What if they dont like ads at all? what is the point of the putting a computer that can read people emotions by scanning their face and the students are not going get any happier they are going be excited about at first and then get bored with it.

I got to see Europe and China. My friend and I got to help a lot of people during our time, too. There is also time to play around on the boats after you unload all the animals. I loved to play volleyball and baseball. Also, we played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The program helped open up my eyes. It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It might be a little hard at first ,and rough, but you'll get the hang of it. After all that, just think of how good you'll feel after knowing you've helped people. Signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity for you. If you like to have spare time, help people, and have a lot of fun, Seagoing Cowboys is the job for you. Participate today! ",2

He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. the United Nations Relief and rehabiliation Administartion hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the Mule that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys. The cowboy, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead his family to host a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet his family was very proud of him. When he turned 18 I bet he was excited because he could be drafted for miltary service. Then when his board learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to just keep doing that for service.

The reason you should join the Military is because you could save a life. Several of lives. Also because we probably need more people because we could always use more people to protect us. Luke made nine trips after 1947.    ",2

Another good thing about it is that you can travel around the world and the states like if there are more animals do in need because they are in danger and almost extinct!

The best part is that you go out around the world and help out everything and if you are in the news for that and the people see that you were on the news with all of you friends then they might as well congratulat you.

Once they see that people can do that to world then they might want to join because they to. When you around the world that means you might go to Asia and a lot of places that were very good in need like China,Japan,Mexico,Australia, and the best for helping out animals is probably Antartica.

People might say wow that bad because it's really cold there and that Therese really nothing we can do there but there is. You can help the endanger Penguins and sea lions that are there and bring more food for them and ever since the globe warming went up Antartica is slowly melting but then getting more snow but the heat are killing penguins. Maybe go to the polar and save some Narwhals or some other animals like polar bears.

So go around the world helping Elaphants,Penguns and also rhinos or just a lot of animals and other counterinsurgency that are helping animals and build more thing for them like China and the pandas and make more cities or homes for the homeless.

And plus maybe going around in the snow helping animals in the Polar or Antartica Isent so bad and helping out others with water and food and re building things for countries and that means you are doing something good for the world to.

They discover the face in 1976,that is when they took the photo they lastest image is from 2001. Also another scientist are saying (am one of them) that ""It is just a rock"". It has natural grow & its not a mask & just a rock. But who knows no one knows.

Did you know that 50% of scientist think that it is a mask from aliens & the other 50% of scientist think it is just a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveilded the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation. . .which resembles a human head. . .formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes,nose & mouth."" And i still think it just a rock,if it were an aliens face or an human face tell me how did it got their.

Do you still think that its still their (i do so) because it is a rock,rocks dont die,they are hard rocks we have & they never die. But am not that convience how can a rock change by its years,but also maybe because it is a different type of rock (its in the space) I thinking that the rock changes by the time.

The coding that this new computers have his so amazing because demostrates how technology had been make and evolution in so many people and not only people also around the world. But this kind of techology also is not the best because it put your identity in danger because the emotions that you make the computer stores all the emotional expressions and maybe with the time another people will have or find access to this archives.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" The text finally states, "" To an expert, faces dont't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human expressions because sometimes people likes to be alone when they feel sad, so they likes like to text with other people but the only thing they are looking at is the computer. The computer may been seen how the person is feeling because looks at some exactly angles on their faces to identify they real emotinal expressions of that moment when nobody is looking at them and may stores them so the computer have and example how the person faces looks like when is sad, happy or angry and also when the person is smiling and the smile is force because when a smile is forces always will look like very diferent because the muscles are making other movement, very different when the smile is spontaneousand real.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be able to identify human emotions because have the carateristics that make it unique to identify emotionals expressions and that will be not possible if the help of science will not be there to support this new technology and give some advices to make this possible and valuable for the scientists and the people that are using it to take advantage or for something really helpful witch may be the case for some people that hide their emotions, this technology can be a treatment for them that can show they are not the only ones and with that problem and it is normal but they have to be happy with this new technology that can help them.

It's been founded that the great picture of Mona Lisa painting of Lenardo da Vinci. That Mona Lisa in the art was eighty three percent happy, nine percent digusted , six fearful and 2 percent angry. It's interesting for people to know such little detail from a great iconic peice from old history, where the Mona Lisa was really intended to bring smile to us.

This reaches out for students for are open up in the science world learning about the functions of Prof. Thomas Huang computer software. The computer targets risorius and zygomatic if a smile isn't being truthful of ones smile.

genuinely working on your smiles that help you smile more in a better happy mood.

In concluison the Computer facial emotion scanner is a big vaulable learning for students to learn about the invention of Prof. Huang. Many will know more futher behind the laws of the muscles of facial emotions based of the FACS (Facial Action Coding Sytem) and learn to scan are emotions.   ",2

To take care of the animals you will have to keep there stalls clean, and get their hay from the lower holds on the ship. Some places take about two weeks or even up to a few months to arrive. Once you loaded all the animals up and took care of them and the animals home is clean and provides food in the wild and in the safe areas, then you will unload the animals off the boat and take them back to where they belong. After all the animal are gone you get to have fun since there is no animals to take care of. Now that all the animals are gone you get to have fun and play games like baseball and volleyball in the empty holds that animals were in and been housed. There will also be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

First , using a self-driving car

They believes that they will fundamentally change the world. You would need to pay close attention to the road ,and even though it is self driving you would still need to keep in controll in the steering wheel.

Second , Self driving cars can be hard to handle . None of the cars are completely driverless. They can be steer , accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigation through work zones and around accidents.

The combinataion of all this input is necessary for thr driverless car to mimic the kill of a human at the wheel .

Third, Self driving cars are using a lot of safety skills . In case of bad traffic the car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Manufacters are considering using cameras to watch the that drivers remaining foucused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.                   ",2
02dabc0,"Do you think theres a real alien artifact on mars? Well if you do, im sorry but there isn't. Even thoe ""the Face on Mars"" may look like an alien artifact, is just a natural land form. There are many of these in Cydonia and they're called Martian mesas. This Martian messa looks as if it's a face because of its unusual shadows that creat the illusion of eyes, a nose and a mouth.

In April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michale Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture, that is 10 times sharper than the orignal one tooken by Viking 1, of the face on mars. This picture finally revield that there was no face on mars, but a natural landform.

This didn't satisfi many people. They thought the alien markings where hidden by a haze, since that was the time of year where that part of mars gets clody. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor took a final look. Then, when they finally found it Malin?s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera?s absolute maximum resolution.? Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

What this thing actually is is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" which are landforms common around the American West. This was simply a chance for NASA to get a little money.                                      ",2

Mostly because of the winner-take-all system. If you were to vote for a presedent, you are in favor, everyone would like thier vote to be counted,right? and it is,but is it really counted towards the presedent we want to get voted for elections?

According to this article, you dont really vote for the presedent you want, what you are really voting on is a state of elector, and if he gets elected he is the one who really gets to vote for the precedent. And that is unfair, I think we should change it to popular vote. We should change it to polular vote because the elecoral college is really unfair to Americas citizens. Also alote of people argue about the winner takes all system because candidates dont spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. Also it is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

Like I said it is unfair, outdated, and irrational,with all these things I dont think many people would like that .So I think we should change it to popular vote, i think it would be easyier and it would be more fair,and that is what our citizens want. And that is what we should give them. After all its thier vote that counts, so lets let them decide if we should keep it the same with the electoral college or change it to some way better like by popular vote.

so according to all this information I think we should change our way of voting and flip everything around to something fair and effective. We need somthing that would make our vote count. somthing that would be fair to all of our citizens. after all its what we choose then thats what we ned to be happening. only you can prevent unfairness.

0329d02,"I am against driverless cars because I think the electrical components and computer software are more likely to fail than a human driver. The idea of a driverless or smart car was actually a really dumb idea if the smart car was really 'smart' then it could navigate its way through roadwork but people just keep getting lazier and lazier their always looking for much easier ways of doing stuff, my personal opinion is that we need to go back to making vehicles like we did in the 1970s they were simple, easy to fix, and were real nice looking vehicles. The human drivers of a driverless car can easily be distracted by all this technology the car manufacturers have put in and on these vehicles that they could be driving and end up in a fatal crash just because they was distracted by some 3-D lazer mapping or a camera on the inside of the car.

These kind of cars would change the world but people would regret it later on in the years when more and more people get killed because of them.

032a3bf,"""Here we go again, sirens."" ""How many accidents is that now, three in less than a week?"" Car accidents are increasing by the minute as decades pass. Drivers are losing their lives each and everyday, familes are greiving over loses, friends, siblings, relatives are being lost due to drunk drivers and young teens just now starting to drive. The air pollution is also getting worse because of vehicles that are used everyday to get from point A to point B, gas prices are rising and sometimes you cant even get to places sometimes because theres so much traffic in the street! We can prevent many of these problems by simply limiting the use of time people spend driving .

U.S. citizens should have a right in the dispute people are having over this topic. Should the U.S. limit the use of vehicles being used everyday? Yes. Millions of dollars are wasted everyday for people need gas in their vehicles to get to where they're going. Money that could be used to feed their familes or money that also can be used to buy clothes and other necessary things. There are Amercian citizens that live on the streets or in alleys that are in desperate need of clothes, food or even a home & here we are spending it on something that can be replaced by something as simple as walking or riding a bike to where you need to go.

Every year there are more and more car accidents being reported and the number keeps increasing. Teens that are in highschool and are just now driving on the roads are one of the top main causes on car accidents, another main cause of accidents are drunk drivers. Americans like to go to parties or gatherings or even just bonfires with friends sometimes and they drink recklessly. Then when time comes for them to leave, they get in their cars intoxicated, driving to wherever they need to go and boom! Their reactions just werent quick enough or they werent paying as much attention as they would driving sober and they crash into anything that came their way. Injuries were made, a life or maybe more than one was lost all because of a mistake that was made earlier that day.

Another reason why cars should be limited is air pollution. If cars are needed to be used on and everyday basis they should make them more ""enviornmentally friendly"". Some gases in gasoline are toxic and/or flamable. Gasoline can drip on something without you knowing and the tinest spark could ignite something so simple, that could turn into a burning fire. Your belongings could be burned to ashes or your car could even blow up into flames. Then money is needed to repair the damage or valuables that couldnt be replaced could be gone. The burning of everything could also release toxins into the air and cause sicknesses in some or could damage our ozone layer more then it already is.

Im not saying people should be banned from every using vehicles again, but it would help greatly if the usage is limited up to a certain point or instead of destroying, it could be used to benefit our enviornment; even leave it neutral.

Americans need to understand that there is more to life then sitting and letting things happen for you. Go for walks, take hikes, rollerblade, plan a bike ride through the park with the family, theres more to life than cars and vehicles. Sure its nice to go somewhere without having to walk but sometimes its good to have family outings and its also refreshing and fullfilling to feel the crisp, cold air hit your skin, walking outside the house on a cold day.

So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that.

The Electoral College is a very organized way of handling the Presidential election. It makes certain that tthere is usually a landslide victory. The locations of the states help the canidates and the Electoral Colloege states that you have to have transregional appeal.

The swing states such as Florida, are the states presidental canidates pay attention to. The votes there are the ones thats can decide the election. The lager states, due to there large population, also get more Electoral votes.

The Electoral Colloege has helped avioded run-off elections by reducing the complication of it all. The Electoral College is made up of five-hundred thirty-eight electors and all that is need to elect a president is two-hundred seventy electoral votes. The electoral College is the easier and less complicated way of electing a president.

Though whether the Electoral College is democratic, it is not true in a modern sense. It is still very practical and less complicated. The people instead would vote for slates of electors but, they still would be voting towards you canidate. The Electoral College is the method that we should keep.    ",2

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything.

039e817,"Dear state senator,

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

The real question is, do you want your teacher to know if your happy, sad, mad, fustrated, confused, or board?

To some, the answer is simply yes, the ones who want others to know what ther are feeling are mostlikly a socil-type person.

On the other hand, its a simple no, if you know somone is gauging your emotions, say you didn't want anyone to know your mad, angery, or sad, would you be afraed to make any exprestion at all, or even go to class.

Nowadays, being watched is a normal acurance, but not to the personal level as to your emotions or thoughts.

Many may ask, what good is it to know about how one is feeling, the answer is unclear.

In paragraph six, the artical tells how helpfull FACS could be to the classroom, but if students should learn anything about real life, its crucial for them to understand, you can't please everyone, as much as you try, you won't.

If you have walked into a elementery school in just the past year, you will notice some very different souroundings.

All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

"" As an official of the Transportation for America, David Goldberg is a credible source for information regarding transportation in America. However there are places all around the world were automobiles are causing problems. Limiting car usage could help solve many of those issues.

In America, the topic of alternative transportation has been? discussed many times, but in previous bills, 80% of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport. This can be found in paragraph 9 of the first source as the fifth line. Sadly America is not the only country having problems. In

Paris, France , diesel cars make up 67% of the vehicles and the diesel feul is blamed for the smog accumulation in the city. In Paris, A warmer layer of air caused by cold nights and warm days, trapped the car emissions which then caused a five day period of intensifying smog. France's smog build-up rivaled that of

Beijing, China , which is claimed to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. This problem also exists in the States, as transportation is the second largest cause of America's emissions, right behind power plants. To ensure safety anyone who was still driving their car was fined 22- euros or $31.

Bogota, Columbia followed France in their violation fee and charged any violater $25. Bogota has created a

Day Without Cars , in which no cars are used, to promote alternative transport and the reduction of smog levels. Another positive effect no cars can have would be a more peaceful enviroment, as stated in sources 1 and 3. In America, recent studies show that Americans have been buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Although it may be far in the future, America may soon follow the lead of

Vauban, Germany , where it is completely car-free. This probably won't happen anytime in the near future, but the use of automobiles has gone down in the United States. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor company, proposed a city in which, pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, etc. are used to save time, lower emissions and improve safety. He sees this future, hopefully others will too.

Although America might not be exactly like Vauban, it is good to hope that it will get there someday. No cars would result in a calmer atmosphere and a more peaceful lifestyle. Also, it would lower the emissions made by vehicles, which in turn would save the atmosphere, thus saving life on earth. No cars would also help improve safety, both of animals and of people. We may not be completely there yet, but the world will someday have no need for cars and that will be the first step into the future.    ",2

There is alway error in such things known as technology. The idea of a scanning machine can tell how I feel seems a little different.

I don't believe this type of machines should be in our schools. I feel like this could cause confusion anf distrut form kids who don't like it. Sometimes kids like to keep to themselves and don't want some tecaher walking around taking pictures. How do we know if this is truly right. lets say that some kids get areading that they're happy or super sad when really they don't feel like that at all. There's to much error to have happen that it just doesn't seem worth it. If this has actually never been trieed on a living human who says it works. How do we know that Mona Lisa really felt like that. She can't tell us that she's dead.

With schools we need to worry on more important stuff. at times we seem to wonder why we lose out on so much money this just doesn't seem like a good investemnt. There is to much that can go wrong and not enough that can go right. Maybe later on if this was perfected but for now I don't support this.

03ee9ea,"In this article it talked a lot about how maybe schools could use computers to sensor a student's emotion of either getting bored or losing interest and to be able for the computer to change the lesson slightly to get the students attention, But do you think this would really work? In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. Why? Because some students may have diformaties in their muscles in their face, facial piercings that could afftect they way the computer reads your emotion, or even just simply you face might be showing one expression but you may feel another way.

Not everyone in the world is same so it's really hard to make something like this that would benefit everyone. You also have to think about the cost of these computers, just think normal computers are already expensive, but ones that can read your emotion you can imagaine that those prices would be unbelievable.

As well as every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students. So overall I believe that this product wouldn't be very successful due to a lot of the roadblocks in the way, especially with money involvment. ",2
03fb253,"Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating ""The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy"" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall. Even though its still pretty dangerous and pretty hard work for someone it can still be enjoyable Im not going to say the same stuff I already said earlier so Im just going to say that depending on how it goes and how you act about it it will be enjoyable just wait and see.",2

The town or city would make double or even more of what they are making in public transportation.? The enviornmet would get healthy and make any town less polluted and help in the fight of greenhouse gases.

We all know how expensive gas can be and how it goes up and down.? With cars being took out the only thing we'd need gas for is buses that would transport us.? Our wallets will thank us and so will the planet.

Speaking of the planet greenhouse gases are the talk of the town and will not stop unless we do spmething.? We can help by doing this plan.? We can never undo what we have done to the ozone layer.? However we can certainly not make it worse by doing this.? In fact we could cut down pollution and make bradenton the city it once was.    ",2
042167f,"In Europe, a new trend has started. Many towns have banned the ownership of cars. One town that this happened in is Vauban, Germany. In this town, citizens are living lives without a lot of stress. They enjoy riding tandem bikes with their wives and walking alone. In Paris, the act has been picked up. Since it's so popular, Paris streets hold many cars. Now that the temporary law has passed, the amount of smog has dropped dramaticaly.

When cars aren't used, lives are saved. Car accidents happen very often and oftentimes they are fatal. When you have a car, you become able to get a DUI. Owning a car can bring you extensive fines, even when you make a small accident in a fraction of a second.

With the economy the way it is, who can even afford a nice car? Bikes are much cheaper and safer for people as well as the environment. If everyone in the world stopped using their cars for a month, we might be able to save a species from dying out, or maybe slow the desintegration of the ozone layer. In Yosemite, wolves flee from the roads because of the massive amount of death it causes their species.

Suburban cities are working on making everything walking distance. On the weekends, public transportation is free. If you have an electric car or you're carpooling three or more people, you're allowed to drive in these cities. Because of these new laws that are being tested in certain areas, many people don't have their licenses. Many teenagers today aren't concerned with being able to drive, and many adults live close enough to their workplace to walk there. Although the laws restricting driving can seem very restricting, they will save lives and will give society a chance to have a smarter, cleaner, and safer future.    ?    ",2
0429d4a,"I'm against having driverless cars because I don't think that driverless cars will ever work properly without getting into a wreck on its own. The cars wouldn't even be driverless because it would have to have a person turn them into and out of a driveway or dealing with complicated issues dealing with traffic. You're not just assisting a car you are driving the car still. It isn't 100% on its own on the road you would still have to help steer at certain spots. Therefore they can't be trusted because you could be approaching a stoplight that has a lot of traffic and then your car wouldn't stop you would have to stop it before it caused a wreck.

I would feel much more safe if I had just a regular, normal car that I could drive 100% of the time. The only safe car is a car that has a person in it and driving it. If it was a choice between the driver or the manufacturer I would definately say that it was the manufacturer because a good driver wouldn't wreck, or get injured. The car would though because a self driving car couldn't work and would cause way more wrecks than what there are now. Therefore I would never let a self driving car drive me around.

Like I said it wouldn't even be 100% on its own just the driving straight part of it. The car wouldn't be able to turn or go into traffic on its own, but a person can. That's why I'm against Driverless Cars and why I don't think that any of them would work.",2
043d5a8,"I think that driverless cars are a great idea but are not yet a safe one. What happens if soembody gets in a car wreck while being in the driverless car? I'd sure hate to be the manufacturer of that car because I'd be losing a lot of money. Driverless cars arent a bad idea I mean, there can be many pros and cons, but no one is ever 100% sure that their idea is as good as it needs to be before they can sell it to people, especially when a human being would be putting their lives in the responibility of a man made machine.

Driverless cars can be good for many, mainly working people on the road. Say you are a business man/woman and have tons of work to do because your company or business relies on you to make your people look good. Well, theres been a bit of an interfence with your work and didn't have time, but on your way to work you can focus on paper work and anything else that is required and have it done while another co-worker had not completed their paper work on th ewy to work. All because you own a driverless car and can getg more done. But when you think about the cons of riding in a driverless car you get to thinking, ""well what if I'm focusing on business work and my driverless car crashes?"" Who will be responsible? The manufacturer of course, because there was some type of malfunction where the car doesn't respond correctly to the surroundings. Would you put your life in the programming of a driverless car? Yes, they'll save lots of time and money but how much more would the damages cost to trust a driverless car to get you places safely?

In many cases I guess you can say that riding in a driverless car would come in handy. Maybe they arent the best for the roads, but what about using them for tours around the city or maybe creating them to travel only at neighborhood speeds? I'm sure the manufacturers will find a more safe use for driverless cars or possibly a different type of driverlesss automobile. In the beginning, middle, and end I still think in my head that driverless cars are never going to be a legitimate guaranteed safety vehicle. ",2

That is a good idea because this could impact investigation, like cops figuring out who the're dealing with. For example, say there was a bank robbery and the criminals got away, but soon the cops found them and arrested them, they could either sit down with them and try and work their way around to see if the're is something wrong with them or they could just snap a picture and figure out thier expressions by using the FACS, (Facial Action Coding System). that would make it easier on investigators because the artical says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly"". using video imagery, the new software tracks the facial movements in a real face. This technolgy can improve how well things are animated too, like on tv, and video games. overall i think this is a gonna impact so many cool things that is still to come.

You have six basic emotions that this program can detect just by your mucsles in your face. When they scanned Mona Lisa's face she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry.

Now if people start turnning towards this method of telling how people feel instead of asking them to make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that's not okay. If you want to now how someone feels don't make a 3-D model of their face to have a computer tell you just go up and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better. It amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead of face to face converstations.

Fianally if you scan someones face to see if you can make them feel better than you are doing it all wrong. You need to walk up to that person and say ""Are you okay, what do you need to help you"". Also when you do scan someones face they can put on whats called a ""Fake Smile"" and trick the computer into thinking it's a actual smile, so it will say they are happy when in reality you are mad or upset.

Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural.

Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way.

Have you ever saw something so strange you just had to get a picture of it?! Well if you have, ive done the same! It all started 25 years ago around Mars!

Mission controllers back at the Jet Propulison Lab had to be really suprised of what we have found on Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling aound Mars and found a figure similar to a human face, believe me when i say it, Yes a human face!!!Although scientists found out it was just an Martian Mesa, i still find it pretty cool!

A few days after the photo's were taken, NASA has decided to show everyone and let everyone know about this Matian mesa.The caption resembled a human head. The author thought it would be a good idea to attract attention to mars, and it slowly, but surely did!

The human face like structure has became a pop icon, it has appeared in many places and thing such as a film, magazines, talk shows, apppeared in some books, it even made it to the grocery sotre checkout lines ofr 25 years!!That is a really big deal for just a structure on mars!!Certain people thought the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, which is there own opinion.

Global Surveyor as known as (MGS) went ot the Red Planet on September 1997, 18 long years after the Vikings missions ended. On April 5,1998 Michael M. and his Mars Orbiter camerea as known as (MOC) snapped a picture 10 times better then the Vikings!!Also for the first

time, Mars Global Surveyor flow over Cydonia. Come to find out, there was no alien monument after al!But no everyone was satisfied with this photo.

The camera was really bad considering it had to go through wispy clouds just to see the face.Mission controllers prepaired to look at it again.After a while Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a 2nd look on april 8, 200l. What the picture really had shown was a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, they have all been fooled.",2

If that was the case they wouldn't have gotten their license to drive. In the future licenses wouldn't be a thing if driverless cars are around , there's no need for one if the car just lets you sit there and watch it drive every where,that's just wasted time to get your permit then wait a few months and then get your license for driving.

Before putting any real driverless cars into the real world they should round alot of tests , because they should want everything perfect no messups or anything because that can be very dangerous if the cars system isn't programmed right or anything .

Therefroe it was not aliens.

05cb18a,Today I'am going to convincing you that you should participate and the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that you should participate because you get to go on a cruise like Luke did and the story of A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves story. Also you get to have fun and If you have not been on a cruise before you get to try to have fun why you are doing your work like going to check on the animals but be careful. If you like to be a cowboy and a cowgirl you can participate in the program if you like cruise's and animals. You can always can help out the animals and the people if you see them and you trouble like trying to get there animals to eat and you see them going crazy you can help out. Luke's claims from the article that he try's to like help out the animals by going to check on the animals ever each time to get his work done on time. He one time failed down the stairs to check on the animals but he couldn't work becaues his rib was broken but he was doing fine. Luke was always do his work but he do a good job to finish his job on the cruise. Luke claims was okay because he try to get done so he can check on the animals because he don't wont to get fired from the Cowboy Waves program because he like working as a cowboy he might be a cowboy that's might be why he work there because he can talk to his friend's and he might give people visit's on the cruise to see the animals to get food and to see the animals to. Luke might show you the place if you participate and the program i will to because it sound fun to be and the program. All i was trying to say that you should participate and the Cowboy Who Rode the Waves program because it might be fun because you get to be on a cruise.,2
05d73d1,"Driverless cars would be very effeiciant. There are many pros to having them and it would be very beneficial for many reasons.

Like Sergey Brin said, these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. Since we're already started to run out on this fuel, having these types of cars would benefit us very greatly. If self driving cars could get better alerts for when the driver needs to do something, it would be easier for people to multi task as well. Self driving cars would also be better, because less crashes would happen. From the text, sensors can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response than a human driver could manage. More improvememnts could make driving much more safer.

Although the self drivng cars are not completly driverless now, it would be very possible to do so with funding. If it were possible to make a car completely driverless, there would not be so much doubt about them. There would also be much more safety. Self driving cars would be very reliable. If it is possible to have them by 2020, a lot could change about transportation.

Driverless cars would definitely benefit people today. It seems like a very possible idea. Although there are some flaws about it now, it could definitely happen in the future.",2

This system can also not work as well as thought to..Well if the student doesn't want to do any work then he will make the face that shows he doesn't want to do anything.That can be bad cause then the teacher won't know what the students will like to do,or how the student will react to the work givein.It can be a waste of money as well to the school system because if they buy it and then it doesnt work out then they just wasted money.The Facial Action Coding System can be helpfull and aslo can be not helpfull.",2

In this artical the scientists and the researchers how to figer out how to get close to the Venus and the also study about the Venus.

The best part is that you get to work with and help animals such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So if you like to help and have fun then this program is for you!

Also you get to go across the ocean on a ship and get to receive orders from people to go to places to help and stuff. It could take up to two weeks to get to your destination. Or even a month depending on where you are going for example if you start at the eastern coast of the United States and went all the way to china it could take up to a month!

061ba37,"Is it really, good if u dont use a car day to day? People in Europe have started this new trend of having different suburbs to not have cars. Now, Paris is banning driving due to smog. Also, Clolombia now has a car-free day that made people bike, hike and aslo take buses to work making the streets have less traffic jams. The U.S, one of the most car used nations, has been going down, and in April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was the same as in January 1995. Experts are also thinking that if they encourage people to reduce the usage of cars, that it may help the greenhouse gases problem gradualy.

So one suburb that is already been established and made an car-free zone is Vauban, Germany. This suburb has minimal parking spots and people have easy access to stores. A woman said,

""When i had a car i always tense. I'm much happier this way""

. This movement of making places car-free is called

""smart plannig""

. ""In the U.S the Envoirmantal Protection Agency is promoting

""car redused""

communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.""

In Paris, people were fined if they did not leave their car at home. This was put into place, because smog was intensifying. Also, smog is more in Paris than in any other capital in Europe. Delivery companies lost revenue, but electric cars and public transit was free of charge. After, the smog cleared the odd ruling was rescinded.

Colombia had an idea that was put into place one day and made a change in everybody. They made a program which is a car-free day which made people go hiking, biking and they rode buses to work. It made the streets clearer. It was put into place so that it woulg help the reduction of smog. This peogram helps people to know other ways to transport themselves without cars.

The U.S is the nation that has the most cars used. So, now they are trying to decrease the use of cars. A study showed that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009.

If you are saying we aren't voting for the president we want then we are just voting for the electoral voters we want without knowing that.

If everyone voted for someone thew electoral voters could just vote for whoever they wanted to and we wouln't be able to stop them either. We should change it to popular vote because the electoral college is unfair to everyone who votes for someone. Its not fair because the eletoral vote can make a president lose even if he had the popular vote is on his side.

I think electoral collage is is a stupid process and is definitly outdated.

In the same light, I think the electoral collage is a stupid idea beacause and that they should of got rid of it a long time ago it is like were not even voteing annymore its like someone messed up the votes and said that romney got 538 votes and obama only got 438 votes. Like bob dole said,""abolish the electoral college"".

but you have to remember, the electoral college is a good thing to most presendental elections. the only one election that it didnt help on was in 2000 al gore recived more indivisial votes than george bush nationwide, but bush won the election, reciveing 271 electoral votes to gore 266.

When driving you really have to pay attention to not just yourself but other people. If you let the smart car drive you around it's not going to really be paying attention to other people.

The founding father that discovered Electoral College made it easy for anybody to be president. Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. On the other hand many people belive that Electoral College is unfair to some people. Many people want to abolish Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be declared the candidate who recives the most popular votes. The electoral restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate. The Electoral college avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion I think that Electoral College should stay and it will make things easier for all these reasons I listed from the sources. Also all the presidents will have a chance to become what they want to be.       ?    ",2
0693237,"Have you ever wanted to go see Paris for free and still help people in need? Well, now you can by just volunteering and becoming a seagoing cowboy. So here are some advantages of becoming a seagoing cowboy.

First of all, you can get some character by volunteering and helping out. So when you are a sea cowboy you have to do work all the time so you are busy so then if you have to you can learn how to clean, feed, and water animals on a farm.

Another thing is that you can help people and make someone happy. Don't you just love the joy you get when you help someone in need? Well you can have that feeling all the time if you volunteer because you are always helping people in need by giving them animals to eat.

For the record, you can see amazing monuments and other amazing things by just volunteering. You get to see these things for free because you have to go to some places like how I saw the Acropolis and I took a grondola ride so that was fun.

Something else is that you can get out of the drafts. I know because when I was on the ship, Iturned 18 and they said to keep going for my service and so that made me happy.

06d752e,"Dear state senator,

I think we should change the election by popular voting for the president of the United States because under the electroral college system, the voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. They should change it for many other reasons, at the most likey level, electoral college is not fair to other voters because of all the winner that take it all system in each state.

Plus candidates don't even spend their times in the places they know they would have no chance of focusing on the tight races in the states or in no chance of winning. The electoral college is practically unfair, outdated, and irrational. I mean the electoral college can have some good outcomes such as the non democratic method of selecting the president that would be overruled. When you're voting for an electoral college you're actually voting for a slate of electors. They usually avoid the problems of the elections in which none of the candidate gets a majority of the votes that are casted. In some states they know their votes will have no effects. The most thoughtful people that vote should be the ones that decide the election.

Electoral college are retained because of its lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative. Elections are only a few of voters away from catastrophe. In elections there could be ties, deadlocks, in Hawaii they had voted the other way. Their are many campaigns about 17 states didn't see the candidates at all including South Carolina, a lot of voters didn't get to see campaign ads. Some win the popular votes but lose the presidency. About 60 percent of the people prefer a direct election from what we have now.

Voters that are now in the presidential elections are people who want to express the political preferences rather than to have people who think single votes can decide an election. Winner-take-all method of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates. Some other things begin equal, a large state gets more attention from the presidential candidates in campaigns than a small state.       ?       ?    ",2

0711276,"My argument against driverless cars, would be that first of all it would be really dangerous, many kids play outside how are the driverless cars going to see a young kid run across the street? Next is that yeah it might be gas saving but think about how much gas is already waisted in our world? lots plus, he saids in his artical "" fundamentally change the world "" or are these driverless robotic automoibles going to change the way people live today? think of themselfs not to good enough becusae you might not be able to afford these 'cars' or for the wealthy who knows he can buy tons of them feel way to good of themselfs? other words better than others in there point of view. plus many people bought many cars. WHAT are they going to do throw them away not many people going to automaticaly leave all these cars and right away move on to these driverless cars.                    ",2
07122f0,"There are many different plants in our solar system. You may have a favorite one or maybe you're just not that interested in it. Well have you ever thought about taking a trip to the moon or just the planet period maybe even studying a planet just for fun? It will cause you to think about the 5 w's first the who, who will be there are there lots of humans just floating around in space? what will it be like, what would it look like? Why did someone create this?

when did everything take place? Why did it take place? Where did everything all begin And what made someone think of this ?

Let's say you studied Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planted in our solar system. It could be by far the most exiciting plant that you could ever study and the greatest dangerous one too. Beyond high pressure and heat Venus geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Venus causes many things to corrupt without venus there would be many corruptions in the world. But so does any other planet right? Not every planet is a good planet.

How is Venus tested and when was it discorved ? According to the text,"" Many astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planted in our solar system"" The text also states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. "" Different plantes have been here for over 1,000 years crazy right, If you was to imagine what life would be like with out planets or gravity keeping everything in check what would we be up to right now. We need these things to survive.

Venus could be the most by far dangerous planet to visit the text says ,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". The text also states that, "" On the plantet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This goes to show that if you were able to take a trip to Venus you probaly would pass out or either die because the tempature is not average compared to the Earth's and there's less oxygen.

You might take it into concederation that we should not be limited to on things we want to do just because the danger of things, and I agree because the world be so much better if we did what we wanted. Studying a planet and actually going to see about it could be someone's biggest dream but they are stopped by it because of the outcome. Many people say chase your dream but how if we stuck in the same mind frame as everyone else.      ",2
0742654,"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.    ",2
0746d1a,"There are some good and bad examples in this article. It is a easy side to choose weather you want to agree or disagree with the development of theses cars. The side I would have too choose is not to agree with the development of these cars.

I would have to disagree because if i'm driving down the road and the car stops working because of an accident that happened. Who's fault is it? Like the article said, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the maufacture?"" If it is the cars fault, the driver would be aloud to sue for the faulty of the car. If it was the drivers fault, then they would have to pay for the damage they have caused.

What would happen if the sensors in the car stop working, in the middle of the person driving? Let's say you're driving down the road, the car in front of you slams on their breaks because of a read light. Your car can't stop because of the sensors are not working, you can't take control because the car has control to stop you. You skid down the road, hitting the other car. What happens next?

In conclusion, before they start selling these cars, they could at least take more time fixing the things that go wrong. Would you want to have something go wrong with the car, then it be your fault? They could try something new if they can't seem to fix the problem. Or maybe they should just stop trying to take away some of the driving privliges from the customers. This is not a good idea for the future. It could go wrong in so many ways.",2
0759934,"How do you feel about the idea of Driverless Cars? They say that driverless cars when be helpful and much more safe. They can even form a public taxi system.

The cars use half of the fuel of today's taxis. It's told that the cars have drivin more than half a million miles without even crashing. The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars by your position on driverless cars.

Reading this article i'm not sure if i'm against it of not. Things that

ran through my head when they asked,"" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore"". Well the thing that I thought about were like Why? I dont really see the purpose of these cars at all. I mean yes, it would be nice from people bussiness people that have to drive thousands of miles each day. For the people just living and normal life like driving to the store or to a friends house, I dont see why they would need them. Is it really as safe as they say it is? Now as I think about the driverless cars more and more, I think i'm going to say that I am against the driverless cars.

I would understand why people would be for the driverless cars. They won't have to drive their kids everywhere, They won't need to worry about drinking and driving, and they won't have to worry about falling asleep while driving. Yes, those are all good resons but they should know already not to do that stuff. I think it's just a way for people to become more and more lazier each day. What if they stop working one day and someone gets hurt , and all that is left is those driverless cars and no body wants them anymore but there is no more normal cars. Then what are we gonna do.",2
076f000,"Everyone and even myself thought this thing was some kind of face created by the aliens. But all this is a land form on Mars called a butte or a mesa. Because it is not a face or an alien object it is just land formation on Mars.

First we all thought it was a face made by aliens from a monument. But ""there was no alien monument after all after upgrading our cameras to get a better view of this so called ""Face of Mars"". Then after twenty-five years of looking at this thing for many years people thought through those twenty-five years that it was a sign of life of mars. On April 8, 2001 we got to the spot to were the face is and every pixel of that picture took that day proved that it was no face but a lava dome that is common around the West of America. A few people at NASA said that it reminds them of the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All those years of hoping and trying to believe that there is life on Mars all just stoped after we all found out it was just a big land formation. Twenty-five years of making a camera better in every way imaginable just to take a sky view picture of a rock!",2
0778075,"Have you ever thought what venus could actually do and what it contains good or bad effects? Well acccording to the article there is various reasons why it can be worthy despite the dangers it presents. Venus is sometimes refered to as the evening star it is one of the brightess points of light in the dark sky. It is also the second planet from our sun. In the article it says that "" venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth"". It is still good to study it though so you can know more information about it

Altough venus may seem to be good it can present different types of dangers. In paragraph three the first sentence it says that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus"". This isnt good it makes the conditions bad and this is something that the humans never encountered before on earth. This could have bad results such as an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustimed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans nad it says it could also liquefy many metals.

Learning and knowing about venus is important so you not only you know about it but what it also contains the pros and cons. Knowing the value of it and what it conatins is important.

In conclusion, is why these reasons is important to know about Venus.You can know about whats happening and if something occurs you now know why. Venus has its own value and ""human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.    ",2
077cf8e,"What are your thoughts on the face? Well I think that it was created by aliens. How is that even possible, how can you belive that the face was created by aliens. Well how could you possibly think that it is a humans face, thats impossible. When the team snapped a picture ten times more clear than the original Viking photos, and

When NASA posted the picture on a website, it revealed that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, also proving that it was not an alien monument in the first place.

But still after proving that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, still not everybody was satisfied. Some people still think that since it was cloudy at that time of the year, the camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy, white, and fluffy clouds to be able to see the face. Skeptics were still saying, ""Perhaps the alien marking were conseled by the wispy clouds.

NASA decided to go back to Mars on April 8, 2001, MGS came close enough to get a second look. The team captured an extraodinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resoultion.

077eeea,"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers by, in paragraph 3 and 4. The explanation of the evidence from the artical that supports my calim would be in paragraph 5.

I will also be able to tell you how well the author supports his idea. Which is by, out of all the other paragraphs, he is actually writing all the main ideas and supporting his claim and idea in this whole artical. Also in paragraph 5 it says, ""The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". Also in paragraph 3 it says, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". Plus, in paragraph 4 it states that (or askes that), ""If our sister planet is so in hospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface?"". In paragraph 1 it states that, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Venus,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple to evem an amature stragazer to spot'. Noe in paragraphn 2 it says that, ""Often reffered to as earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" So now in paragraph 6, it states that ""However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safley far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rending standards forms of photography amd videography ineffective."" Plus, in paragraph 7 it states that, ""NASA is working on other aprroaches to studing Venus.""

because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating eneavors.""

The rate of accidents could go dramastically because the people that drive irratically would no longer be behind the wheel.

There would be a computer sterring the wheel. People could not speed unless tey were in controll. SO therefore less speeding tickets.

The economy could get better because more money would get made from saling these cars. The junkyards would make more because a lot of people would scrap their old cars so that they could get those new carss. So that would be plus to all of these too.

More jobs would open up to statr selling these drivless cars so poverty would go down. This be a great thing so less people would be homeless.

If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.

My personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community aroused and it did indeed. In the passage it said ""It even haunted grocery lines for 25 years!"" and also it played its part in movies and things like that. And only recently in 2010-2016 has there been ANY proof there has been any life or there may be any life there what so ever. The reason of that is they found a river or something I can't exactly remember. And also they (N.A.S.A.) don't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so hin and so hot they believe that it would be hard for something to grow and live on the planet mars.

All people have a structure for their own living while following their beliefs or customs. Human beings have evolved from a variety of settings which has enabled them to create enternal memories or daily habits of their own kind. Individuals studying another environment such as Venus will bring different and numerous facets to their life. People practicing the components of the planet Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the planet's features, the knowledgement that scientists will discover, and the producement of devices.

To begin, Earth is a contrasting planet that isn't identical to any other aspect in space. However, the planet earth and Venus have obtained similar qualites that would result into a much bigger asssumption. Centries ago Venus had acquired oceans that covered the planet just as Earth. According to the passage, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Life forms being a possibilty on Venus protrays that any kind of living such as humans or animals can be capable of surviving on this planet. Even though life has the ability to live on Venus, the only obstacle involved with this theory are the animals and human beings adapting to a new way of living. Moreover, people and animals getting use to their new structure of life on Venus will be able to use the qualities that the planet performs as of today. The passage states, ""Today, Veuns still has a some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar featres such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus having the same facets as Earth represents that life on this planet will destruct and kind of livng. At last, the studying and the consideration of life on Venus will be an enormous movement for the nation.

Venus is the second planet from our sun .While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous sacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere

However ,perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far abover the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mot forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere ,rendering standard forms of photgraphy and videography ineffective .

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus .For examle ,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been teted in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weks in such conditions .The thought of devices make a calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our planet .The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys ,mountainsand crater ,Furthermore,recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit ,a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel

Lets say your're talking to a friend of yours and they ask you what you think about their favorite song and you know its their favorite song, but you really don't like it all and you dont want to maybe hurt their feelings by saying what you really think, so you might say "" it's ok"" or ""not my style"".

This techology could be helpful to scientists for many uses or like in the article says for identify paints or surgeries. In the following paragraghs i will give my reason why its a good reason to the FACS and evidenece.

The reason i agree that they should have the FACS is because it could be used for alot of things like see who is confused or lost, and if someone is lying when they are introuble, and even if they need it for a painting like this artcle. I think people always questioned if mona lisa is happy or mad, or even confused. In the artricle on paragraph 3 it says that the computer can classifi if someone or some painting is happy, sad, anger, fear, and disgusted. So what they did is they made the painting 3-d and scanned her face to see what was her emotions were during da vinci was painting and also it says that the computer can also major 44 muscles on our face and can tell if we are happy or sad. on paragraph 1 the result of what emotion mona lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful andf 2% angry. this result could be right or just what the computer thinks what her emotion was in that very moment da vinci was painting her.

084e848,"I think that the idea of driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are necessary at all. They are pointless and cars should be driven manually. The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen.

A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, ""psychological aspects are really a challenge,"" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the investment. They will still need human assistance and drivers will be bored waiting for their turn to drive.

May 24, 2001 was when the Face was first spotted. There were no other other landforms or artifatcts spotted on this mission. This is the first problem. If there were aliens that previously inhabited the plant, why would there be no other evidence? The only factor making it appear to be an Egyptian Pharaoh was the shadows casted on the rest of the structure. Though Michael Malin was able to get closer,clearer pictures of the landform, it still did not give straight evidence that aliens exsisted. If the Face did prove that aliens did once walk Mars, why would they be Egyptian? Scientist can only compare the structure to what they know, which is not much. Since the Face is equal to a mesa or butte, how would that be possible? Mesas and buttes are not caused by man, but by erosion and natural processes. The Face was most likely formed by coincidence.

Though there is no exact explanation for the Face on Mars, it is still interesting. If you belived in aliens, you would believe in is an artifact left by ""Martians"".

085f158,"Dear State Senator,

Lately there has been lots of tense debates on whether to keep Electoral College votes or not. Well I agree with the citizens who do agree on keeping our votes. Its just rude to take away something we rightfully deserve. Electors come to the campus or a specific area to give their great speech that appeals to what we want to be done just to get our votes. Well Mr. Senator it isn't ok for you and the others in office to just take away Electral College voting.

According to this article written by : The Office of the Fedral register,

"" the Founding fathers esatblished it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popuar vote of qualifed citizens.""

that little bit of information says a popular vote I believe the Electoral College is that popular vote. After the electors are selected and meet to discuss who would be Preident and Vice President but also need to count the Electoral votes. Not only does the congress count the electoral votes , there is 538 electors but at least 270 votes are required to elect the preisdent.

In another article it explains how the year of

""2000 was a fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.""

There is a example

Al Gore he won the popular vote but not the presidency .And that majority would have preferred a direct election. Also the electoral voters system voted slate, an example given from the story was if I lived in Texas I would vote for Jonh Kerry, then vote for slate of 34 democratic electorsthat pledged to Kerrry.

Even with great arguments of wiping out Electoral votes , it will still remain

""unfair outdated and irrational

"" I see a picture which shows the number of electroal votes that each state is granted. Some states are granted more than other states but that doesn't stop them from voting. There are fueds over the outcome,picking the president, then goes into the swing states, Big states, and run-off elections .

Now the certainty of outcome of a Electoral vote its not likey to beat a popular vote.

But electoral votes win because those votes are more than popular votes. Back in 2012 voting the article says"" Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the poplular votes.""

and that help Obama win on the winner-take-all basis. Now with picking the president they can't recieved gain of votes where ever there from or very well favored. A president with regional appeal isn't likey to be a successful president.

Now those swing states, with the winner-take-all method and being awarded with electoral votes. But voters in the toss-up states are the ones who really pay attention and listen to competators in the campagion. And decide the election. But in the big states electoral college restores the political balance which large states lost by virtue. The bug states get more of the canidate attention than small states because big states has more population.

Refering back to the article it says electoral avoids the problems with elections , with that no canidate recieves no votes from that majority.

Imagine back in 1968 with Nixon and Clinton in 1992 both only gotten 43 pecent of the popular votes . The pressure of a run-off election is when no canidate wins , it will greatly make things complicated in the presidental elction.

So no Senator you and your fellow peers whom decided to eliminate electoral votes is dispicable. When we actually have a chance to vote you take it away. Its very clear that without the electoral votes it woud be more than just presidental complication it would also be complication with decideing electors, presidntal electors and the big states who canidates get there precious votes from would have a hard time winning.

I agree to keeping the Electoral College vote and not to change it to no popular vote because popular vote over rules most of the time. So please over think your decsion with other senators and keep Electoral College votes.    ",2

The author supports the idea very well because he added facts. Also he did very well with suporting his claim because he have good look passages. also he states that, ""Also notatable,Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closest to the sun"". So this means that Venus is dangerous even if you go to it is too hot to even step foot on.

In conclusion, studying Venus is an worthy Pursuit because you can find alot of facts and statistics about Venus. The author states that "" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening star,"" is one of thr brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer. So, this mean Venus isn't just an planet it aslo is an eveaning star. I have went through all the evidence that the author excellently supports his idea.",2
08669b6,"You have to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It will open the world up to you. The program is really fun, and could help you with some of your problems. It really helped me in life. You get to see cool things. You can relax. Then sometimes there a lot of work involved. Anyone could be interested if they tried.

The article says there is a lot of war like things involved as well. It gets pretty dirty and rough to be a seagoing cowboy. I would suggest doing because it gives you oppertunities, and soemtimes it can be fun. You can't be weak and not willing to do work though. There is a lot of training to go through and it is not easy. So if your a hard working worker this is the place for you to be.

Then there are some severe injuries or even worse. You got to be tough though. I have a good time though. Beside the work, but sometimes it can be fun. You have company as well to cheer you up when your down. Some work you have to do is cleaning, feeding the animals, or even pulling or pushing heavy objects. Like in the article it said the animals have to be fed or watered two or three times a day.

Yet all the work there is fun. Like seeing all of the awesome landscapes or cities. If you feel down this will bring you up. Watching the sun set. Being with workers that are kind. There is more and more. It is just what kind of person you are. If you are a hard worker and like to see cool things. This is the place for you. It is really fun if you can see how it is fun to help people and animals. L hope this inspires you to be a seagoing cowboy. The program is great.         ",2
087f29f,"Dear State Senator,

Haven't you ever wondered why the poppular vote seems to have the majority of votes for a candidate? This due to the unfairness of the Electoral College. The Electoral College has to be eradicated mainly do to many factors such as the ""Disaster Factor,"" the Winner-Take-All"" system, and the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. These events can all cause a crisis in the country due the the Electoral Colleges unfairness.

One reason the the Electoral College can be considered unfair is due to something that we refer to as the ""disaster factor."" This is a possibility in which a state legislature is responsible for picking electors that vote based on their bias. This can be considered unfair mainly due to the fact that they did not follow their plegde to the citizens of their state. For Example, in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature choosed a group of electors in which the promised the people to vote for John F. Kennedy. In the end vote against Kennedy and not complying to their pledge. Luckily, Nixion, Kennedy's opponent, validated only his opponents electors, without establishing a precedent.

The Electoral College has to be disposed of because of a system used in almost every state, called the ""winner-take-all' system. This can be considered unfair and prove the system as outdated, bec    ",2

You should join because UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care or the horses, young cows, and mules that where shipped overseas. Its a important job to take care of the animals there our resource! You get to see and vist amazing places! And when you are in the program you get to help people out and help them recover. Its a good and nice thing that you are helping people out.

In the book ''A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'' A character from that book name Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime! In 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries where left ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).

Then in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14. Luke then says,''the day the Pacific war ended.''

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Then Luke was on a cattle-boat trip, they told Luke to just keep doing that for Luke's service. Luke was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. For Luke the cattle-boat trips where unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says.

Besides Luke helping people, he had side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special for Luke. And Luke got to go to a gondola ride in Venice , Italy,a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Maybe if you Join the Seagoing Cowboys program you can experience all these wonderful places like Luke did! And you can be helpful in this program.

On Luke second trip, he had to serve as night watchman. And his job was to check on all the animals every hour. Now, thats a tough job to do. But Luke was helpful and he did his job and he loves his job he does. To sum things up the jobs sometimes be a little hard to do but Luke never gave up on his job! So this is why you should join the program and help people out like Luke and Don did.",2

It was 1945 and World War two had just ended and the UNRRA joined together and helped the coutries to recover from the war. UNNRA hired ：Seagoing Cowboys： to take care of the cattle that were shipped over seas. Don and I signed up to do this position. In August we got orders to go to New Orleans. I had 335 horses that I had to take care of.

After about two weeks we finally arrived, but caring for the animals kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered at least two or three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be dragged from the lower holds of the ship and the stalls had to be cleaned out. I had helped out at my aunt? farm when I was younger but I was not prepared for the dangers on the sea. On my second trip I was going to go make my hourly report to the captain and I slid down a slippery ladder. A small metal strip had stopped me from going into the dark atlantic, but I was not able to work for a couple days because my ribs were cracked.

This job kept me very busy, and had many oppertunities to see things I have never seen before. I halso had found some times that I could have fun on board instead of having to care for the animals. After the animals would be dropped off we would head back. We played all kinds of activites and games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in empty places were the animals were. We also had table-tennis tournoments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, the games had help pass time.

I encourage ever teenager if you have an opputunity, to sign up for this job. This job I was able to see things I had never seen, it was a lifetime experience, and I was able to stay busy with the animals and then have a little fun. I encourage this job because this is what I did it was an enjoyable jod. I mean how cool is it to ride a ship and take care of cattle. Then after they get unloaded you can even have some fun on the ship. It helped me become more aware of other countries and their needs.   ",2

Here is some more reasons you might want to join the program. So Luke went on a journy with his friend and there was 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed the horses. Luke was going to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

090c52d,"In all honesty, if it were up to me, I would keep the Electoral College. Because imagaine what a catastrophe it would be if we did not have the Electoral College, how would they count the votes. Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,? once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner.

Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. Also, it is possible for worker of the Electoral College to make a mistake in countung the counting the votes and to cause a big confussion in the votes but that is very highly impossible, if not impossible.

If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place?

The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachrosim, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruledbydeclaring the candidate who receives the most popular vote the winner. Not only that, but a disputeover the outcome of an Elecotral College voteis possible-it happened in 2000-but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.

Their are five reasons to retain, or keep the Electoral College. First, it's a certainty of outcome, the winner is everybodys president, it swings states, not only does ig work for little states, but for big ones too, and you can avoid run-off elections.

So those are my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College, we should not overlook the goods that the Electoral College does to our nation just because of two little bad that can be repaired. ? ?       ? ? ? ?    ",2
0912e51,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !",2

In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China.

0980c17,"Dear Senator,

While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote.

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.    ",2

I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will give you some reasons to support my opion.

One reason is they are very caring, because World War II ended, and it is 1945 and many countries were messed up from the war. so 44 nations joined together to help it's called the UNRRA, the UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys. So they both were helping these countries. So that is a reason why you should join because they are caring. Another reason is they go across the world to help countries. So when you think about you can go on tours to some places across the world and go sight seeing, so that is pretty cool. Last reason is just doing the right thing it is a very caring and helpful program to help innocent people who were not in the war, that died and houses got damage. so it is a helpful thing to do and fun thing to join.

some details that support luke claims is in paragraph 5 it says that one of the boys in the smalltown said besides helping people he had time to see Europe and China so like luke said it's not only just helping people you have time to go on tours of places in some of these different countries that you never ever seen that place before and go on a tour of that place in that country. Another detail is in paragraph 8 it says that it is fun on board coming back because they played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments,and a few other games so joining will be fun because when you are on board or on the ship you can play games.

So that is all I have. I think people should really recommend participating in

09af24e,"My argument against ""Driverless Cars"" is that im going for it. The reason why is because we have advanced in our technology so it would only be wise to try and use that. Also because I think personally it could save many lives with its self brake instalation, self parking, and many other features. As I was reaing the artical it mentioned that the driver would have to still be alert because if theirs an accadent or workers ahead then the driver must be the one to avoid that. That dosent mean it a bad idea, it just means that maybe our technology isnt that advanced and cant avid things such as work sites ahead or accidnts. I think the reason they cant detect accidents is because you never know when ones going to happen, same with workers ahead your car may not be able to detect it because it could happen in a sudden flash. My position on driverless cars is that i think it will be a great idea. I like i said save many lives, know im not saying it will save everyones life but out o thousands it could decrease by hundred.

Appropriate details from the artical that supporst my position is when it talks about how it has automic brakes and self parking and many other features. Its great to have that type of things because as i ahve been saying it could save many lifes, and that important because no one wants to see their family dead. Self break is good because it could be late nd you have been working all day long and your tired and you fall asleep in the car right when a car is pulling out or your car turns a different direction and your close to hitting somethong and it just automatically stops. Or like most parents, you have a young child in the back and hes/shes crying andyou turn around for just a split secound and your car just comes to a complete stop.

Everything has been developed to the cars the way around, so why change it now we already took down trees moved everything and are already used to all the cars and everything why change whats not broke? Yah i get that we are polluting everything and anything but we've already ruined everything why stop now. Like come on. They blame it all on deisel fuel when it really isnt the problem the problem is all the manufacturing and crap that they are doing in all of these factories and stuff. Also they state again how its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution we have already polluted it give me a break im so tired of this boohoo crap. President Obama is an idiot hes trying to fix whats been broken and he cant fix the pollution what he can fix is all these lunch rukles because there is no reason why i can't eat candy at school get gatorades get chips his wife can be healthy all she wants but that doesnt need to include us. REcent study shows that less americans are buying cras and you know why because all amerucans pretty much have a car or are broke or homeless. With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession may find less reason to resume habit. Then the3y are wanting to try to change the age again but i dont think that there are any advantages to limiting our car use ability.    ",2

And why would you use that in a class room any way to spy on people thats a little creepy you know and also why would the teacher even what that becouse thats looking at them too. So there for in my choice the technology is not valuale and should not be put into classrooms or anywhere for that matter becouse every needs that privcy and no one will be able to get that if that technology is around. Another reason we should have it is becouse why would you want people to know your exact emotions anyways if they can read your emotions they can pretty much tell what your thinking by that.

09c8185,"Venus is worth studying because when they study it they called it an ""Evening Star"" also a ""twin"" of earth. It's the closest planet to earth, It is the closest in distence as well. Venus also has a 97% carbon diocide blanket, but on the surface its 800 degrees Fahrenheight. Since the conditions of the planet are like that its way to extreme for humans to live there. Venus is also has the hottest suface temperature in our solar system, even thou Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is till hotter. It has eruputing volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequesnt lightning strikes that happen on the surface of the planet. Scientist think that long ago Venus was like Earth, but even now it still has some of the features that Earth has. It has the rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, craters. NASA is working to keep studying Venus. They have done fom silicon carbide tests that are simulations of the chaos of Venus's surface. One of the things is that they are still striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. So if there is a way that they are able to go there and get more samples from Venus, then maybe that might tell the scientist what might have been there before and help them out with the previous clues as what happened. They also didn't think about how fast the computers we have today would be. But they also said that just imagine exposing a cell phone, tablet to acid, or heat compatible of a metling tin, that must be what the heat is like on Venus. And since they can't be on Venus just orbiting or hovering safely they can't get the samples that they want from that distance.",2

Venus's conditions are so harsh that no space craft sent to the planet survived the landing for a few hours Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon dioxide and is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. Its average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That's not all though, Venus also has acid rain and errupting volcanoes. It is truely a harsh planet.

However, NASA had an idea for sending humans to study Venus. This may sound like a crazy idea, but NASA will make sure the conditions will be safe enouph for humans be safe and study Venus. They could make a a blimp-like vehicle hovering about 30 miles above the surface of Venus. At that height, the temperature would be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure would be simular to sea level on Earth. These conditions are a little rough, but survivable for humans.

There could be many new discoveries found on venus. It may be a hard task, but maybe one day, we could find a new discovery that could change the world. Who knows what we will discover on our next mission to Venus.      ",2
09ce958,"Dear, State Sentor

I think the electoral college should be changed and people old enough to vote should be able to chhose who they want to be president.?I think people should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because. And he start destroying?the economy and he starts taking away things that some people need to survive or maintain.

One reason I?think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because what if someone gets elected as president and for example he or she decides to begin a marshal law in the whole united states. Then he starts putting a chip in evevyones body and we get told when to eat and when not to eat. Then he or she?starts to put us in concentration camps and we get paid 2 cents a hour and killed if we dont cooperate.

Another reason?I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be president is because. Its not fair to people cause that would be like a citizens vote?doesnt even count and the government doesnt really care about what citizens think and they dont care about how we feel. Then if the wrong person gets elected and he or does something no one likes everybody gone be mad cause they didnt for that to happen.

Finally I think citizens should be able to vote for who they want to be president is because I honestly dont think the government doent care how anybody feel. And The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college method for selecting presidents may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no carrying their state.

Now you see why I think people should be able to choose who they want to be president. I hope you enjoy reading my letter and i hope you see where im coming from and what im talking about.?    ",2
09d976b,"Venus is the planet of our solar system. Occasionally Venus is the closest planet to Earth in term of size as well as distance. Venus, also known as ""Evening Star,"" is a second planet from our sun that makes it more brighter and warmer. Venus is covered with a large blanket of carbon dioxide. The temperature on the Venus is approximately 800 degrees Fahrenhite, and also has the atmospheric pressure 90 time greater than on Earth, this circumstances make the Human life quite impposible on Venus. Venusian geology has impediments like volcano eruption and earthquickes.

Do you ever feel how interesting it would be to visit places that are out of this world? Or, do you ever thought, what if we get the chance to visit different planets like Venus or Mars? Well, we are no longer away from the time when we will visit different planets for our vacation trips. Although our neighboring planets are inhospitable of human life, however ; Astronomers are fascinated about Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Vinus was covered with oceans and could have supported various froms of life. Even today, Venus have some features that are analogous to those on the Earth. Human's have sent plethora number of spacecrafts to Venus but didn't get success. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to the study Venus. NASA's possible solution to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray, as the temperature would be around 170 degrees Farhrenheit above that land, it will make easier for humans to research on Venus. To get samples of rock or gas, scientists has to conduct a mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persional despite the risks. NASA has discovered that electronic devices made of silicon carbide can last for three weeks on Venus as they will not melt easily. NASA and many other organizations are working hard to make it possible for human to visit other planets.

As we know, how many different condition are becoming hindurance for humans to visit Venus, but we are no longer away from the time when human will visit other planets and will research about that planet. Recently scientists has discovered that their is a life possible on Mars. Many organizations like NASA and Space-X are working hard to send humans to Mars.

09df111,"In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the aurthor suggests studying Vens is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

I believe that the aurthor thinks this because Venus is the closest plant to earth by the means of density and size because of that it is often referred as the twin of Earth.

On Venus the planet in its self is a challenging planet to land on.

The clouds in Venus are made of highly corrosive sulfiric acid.

The temperature on Venus is about eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit.

The atmosphereic pressure is ninty time greater than Earth.

The tick atmosphereis almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide.

Compared to Earth these conditions are far more extreme for humans.

So extreme that there has not been an attempt to explore VVenus in over three decades.

Out of all the planets in the solar system Venus has the hottest surface temperature.

Astronomers believe that Venus may have once been like Earth a long time ago.

Venus might hav had oceans and could have probably supported many forms of life just as Earth.

Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth though.

The surface of the planet is a kind of rocky sediment and has familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

In conclusion I have discussed why the aurthor thinks Venus is a planet worth studying.

I have talked about the conditions of Vens such as the atmosphere and the temperature. Finally I talked about the terrian of Venus and how similar it is to the terrian on Earth.",2
09f2c09,I think that this would be valuable because this Facial Action Coding System really work because in the text it stated that they found out what was Mona Lisa moods. And they figured it out so if they put the computers in a classroom for kids they will find out if they need help or not. Another reason why i think that this computer is valuable is because it can help out the kids and to see if they need help and to also see what they are struggling with so they can fix the problems that the kids are having. Another reason why i think that the computers coding system is valuable to the classroom is because if they feel sad or anything going on at home or somewhere the computer can tell what is they mood and why they have this mood. I also think that this coding system would be good for a classroom because it can help teachers and what i mean is that if the student is struggling and the teacher dont know why the student is struggling but the coding system do the system can tell the teacher what she need to do to help the student understand i really think this would be good for school all over the world the world need this new technology and it need to help us get through school. This concludes my reason on why i think that the technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom are valuable.,2
09f7d1f,"This story is about a new technology that is called a Facial Action coding system that are able able to recognize other people faces. I'm explaining what I think about people using a facial recognition. This whole facial recognition thing is awesome and I think that it is safe for us humans. These people can actually use it for there iphones now. For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device.

The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology. I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea. Another reason why I think this is a cool idea is because it knows who you are even when you have on different face expression. That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that. I some time ask myself how do they do that.

I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.

This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple.

This story told me alot. It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing. I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology. That story was interesting and I think that I would probably use that one day. If I would use it I would be careful with it. ",2
0a0388e,"Dear senator Im arguing in favor of keeping the Electoral collage. It has come to my attencion that people want to change it to election by popular vote for the president of U.S. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it makes more sense and is easier for you guys to count the votes. It is more orginized by level of the voting people lie president, vice president ect.

The Electoral vote consists of 538 electors. The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.

I just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government. This only happens Every 4 year so you got to wait a long time.

I am very imform about this and making a change will only make thinks worse. People are not going to get use to doing another way or they are gonna get confuse with the old one. It going to be a caus if you change it. I just want to make thing better not worse. So you maybe want to consider this more and think about for days and analyist real good.

0a0f8b3,"My position on driverless cars is that they should be used when needed not all the time. They are not as safe as people think they are for the fact that they cannot think for themselves. They will have to have way to many sencersto be able to try to keep every one safe. Safty is a big concern because of all the sencers that are there and one of them go out the othere sencers cant see that spot so if something were in that spot then they would have died.

Some people think smart cars are going to be the next big thing but i dont hink so safty and money are way out of the safty range at the moment and i dont think it is a very good idea because where are you going to get all the money to buy a smart car, I know i would not have enough money for that because i dont have money for a regular car at the moment because wll i just got my job. Just take a minute and think would you want your child playing on the street and this driverless car comes through that same street and the sencer on that part of the car is not working and it does't see your child and runs he\she over?

So in conclusion, Smart cars are not as smart as they seem. They will not be cheep cars to have and if they get themselfs into an accident think of all the money that you would have to

put into it to fix all of the damage that it would have caused itsself. Think about the insurence bill if it accidentaly kills someone because one of the sencers were out. I think that they would bee good to have if you are sick but not any other time i think it would be stupid to even try to have them but that is my opionion on the matter i just wouldn't buy one because i do not wat to be responsible for something tragic happening to anythingor anyone.

A driverless car is exactly what it sounds like. It has a nice ring to it, right? Some people may think it sounds super dangerous, some people might find it quite amusing. Others feel like we are okay with the cars that we have. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. What's yours?

Humans introduce new technology constantly. From phones to computers, from house appliances to buildings, even cars. What's wrong with cars going through a manufacturer for an upgrade? How many people will by the iPhone 7 when it releases? A Lot. How many of those people have an iPhone 6s Plus already? A Lot. Why can't cars be the same way. I mean, maybe it's a waste of hard earned money, but it's yours.

My personal opinion doesn't really make a difference. Although, I do think they should release them. I think they should release them because they literally have no reason not to. Plus, if they decide not to release them, how's that fair to the people that can afford them who've been waiting? Lots of people are cautious about driving with those cars out on the road. Some are scared, some are outrageously mad. Everyone has in the technology business has to come up with something new before long. Another reason I believe they should be released is because of the research. Driverless cars have driven more than half of a million miles without a crash. If you ask me, that's safer than cars WITH people driving them.

In conclusion, everyone deserves to buy what their money can afford and if they can afford it then, why not?                           ",2

I am writing to you about keeping the electoral college. To me the electoral college is key to the United Stats of America. Why would we replace something that has worked for over 200 years?

As you can tell this makes my temper itch just writing about it. This country has run on this system for grnerations but now people clam it is out dated. Now dont get me wrong I see where they are coming from but the only reason I've found that people dont like this system is either because it has some minor hiccups or that the canidate that the person favored lost. Now I understan how this can upset some one but it doesn't mean we have to compleatly abolish the system.

0a8590a,"sould we keep the elecoral collage or should we change it to election by how many popual votes for being the president of the unioted states.

what is the callage electoral ?

the electoral collage is a compromise between electing a president by voteing in congress and election of the president by how many popalar vote for qualified as to be a president.

teh electoral has many process such as meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

oto be elected for president u need to have a majority of 270 electorals votes cause the electoral callage consists of 538 electors under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbai is allocated 3 electors and trated like a statte for purposes of the electoral collage.

pretty much each candidate running for president in any state has his or her own group of electors.

any president thats running for election is held every fore years on the tuseday after the first monday in novermber.

most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winninfg presidential candidate.

elctoral collage they're not alone according to a gullup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage won the popular.

the problem with electrola collage is that under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

thje singel best argument against the electoral collage is whtat we might call the disaster factor. we consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electtors.

perhaps most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. and the election would br thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in eavh state, bcandiadates dont spend time in state they know they have no chance of winninf-g, focusinfg only on the races in the swing states.

collage method of selcting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a sinle vote may decide a n election.

in my conculesion we should change the election by who has most popular votes for the president of the untied states, because it make more scence the election always go by votes and who ever have the most votes is elected for the president of the untied state. the eletoral collage system wasnt that good to many things going on i mean like it was kinad of good but not better then election on popaler votes.

0a919e7,"I think we should keep the electoral college because it at least gives people a say on weather or not the person they vote for gets elected or not, people always say that you can't complain if you don't vote, so I'm sure people wouldn't want to not be able to vote. I'll explain in more detail my reasonings in the next couple of paragraphs.

The first reason for keeping electoral colleges is because people want a say on who's president. America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the pesident is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big desions such as a presidental election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are use to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and the people complain louder than they do praise.

Another reason why they shouldn't take away electoral colleges is because of the amount of complant they would get from everyone if they do decide to take electoral college away. It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless.

Those are basically the two big reasons why voting should be avalable to everyone, and not just left up to sentators and stuff. People want a say on who's running their country and because there will be tons of complaining if voting is taken away from them. So, think before you make a drastic desison like that.    ",2
0a94ac7,"""Mom im going to go outside to get some fresh air"" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean.

Its polluted.

But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a mother of two . She walks verdant streets & love listening to her surrounding.

But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on.

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.     ",2
0aa8caf,"I think that driverless cars are good and bad. A car that navigates its own self, doesn't need a driver to take control of it, uses less fuel, and is controlled by a computer is most likely to be our future. We all want to do greater things, invent grather things, but we should also realize that some things can be thought of but not created. A driverless car has its ups and downs because if no human being is in control it could represent a bad aspect or a bad one. One good thing that comes to the top of my head is elderly people. This would be really useful to the elderly, especially because of muscle or bone aches. It reduces the number of crashes but could also influence them. The computer or whatever is controlling the car could misfunction or something could go wrong, therefore the car could end up crashing or causing an accident. Humans have the most control on a car. They decide the speed, direction, their surrondings. A computer could do thst too but not as acurate as a human would. Yes it is a very interesting thing thst could happen in the future but are we sure that we would want a machine to take over rather than a human. There are lots of arguements that can be done about this. Some people may agree, some people may not and thats fine because we all have different opinions. Driverless cars still have a long way before they can just change what has been achieved for more that maybe 80 years or so, and thats humans having full control.",2

0ac8051,"Dear Senator,

Pensive and melancholic, the debate on whether or not the Electoral College should be kept has had the people thinkinf for many years now. As you already know the process of the Electoral College consists of electors meeting and voting for the president and vice president. Therefore, the people voting only help choose the state's electors when voting for their president. In reality, we all know that when we vote we are actually choosing our candidate's electors. Because of this the people feel like their voice isn't being heard. They believe that they aren't actually voting for their president.

For starters, the majority of people, over 60 percent of the voters, would prefer a direct election instead of having an Electoral College. Under the system we have now voters can't always control who their electors vote for. Sometimes there is a problem where we choose the wrong elector and in turn vote for the incorrect candidate. The majority of people voting feel that their vote does not really count because electors can go against what they promised, and they can vote for whoever they wanted to vote for.

In addition to this, there is a problem if there is a tie in the electoral votes. In the event of this the election would be passed to the House of Represenatatives. This means that it is up to state delegations to vote on the president.    ",2
0acad9f,"The face on Mars as believed by many is not a face but a mesa explained ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". There are many reason to support this. Such as in 1998, Nasa reveled that it was just a landform. Yet there are many who are not satisfied.

In April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The MOC or Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Viking photos that was ten time larger. The first picture of it revealed that it was a natural landform and there were no alien monument. Although it was winter and cloudy the picture was not mistaken since it was ten times larger than the Original.

Then, in April 8, 2001, it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. MGS or Mars Global Surveyor was close enought for another look. The team captured an amazing photo using the Camera's maximum Resoultion. The photo also revealed that the picture shows a butte or mesa which is a lava dome. The article clearly states that the Face on Mars is a mesa.",2
0ad08bd,"I'm not for driverles cars because they can still cause an accident and if any person could, Also there not really driving the car itself but is helping out the driver by stop when they are not looking or if there is a green light then, the car will alert the driver to press the gas if they are distacted. But, it will not drive a person home if they are drunk. There are better ideas then making a driving car. But, instead of buidling drivierless cars we can save the enviroment. They can make the world a better places but make fuel efficeny cars instead of driverless cars. Make trucks not run on diesel we can be doing so much more than making a driverless car. What if the car computer programming chip is damage then that means that the car can't be able to work correctly and that the car is in a higher risk of getting more people in danger because of the driverlesss car.

Building a driverles car is going to be very expensive. And we are not in a lot of debt so we should use are money wisely.    ",2
0ad1f49,"The face on Mars was spotted by a Viking 1 spacecraft. When the spacecraft was circling the planet and snap shotting photos of landing sites for Viking 2, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The face was first dicovere in 1976. The last snapshot was taken in 2001.

Some people believe the face was made by aliens in Mars and aslo that it could possible be made by the atient Egypt. This face became a pop icon. The face has starred in Hollywood films and it has appeared in books and magazines. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.

After all, the face is just a landform that the shadow had made it more like a face. There are no evidence where the face had other connections to be discovered. It was naturally formed by the land and the rock formation and also the shadows that made it look more like it. ",2
0aefcef,"Yes, I can see where you are coming from this is because there has been some talk about aliens in the past. Though I can assure you that this is a nautural landform that takes the shape of a face. Sir, I am asking to you please take what I am about to say into consideration. Just listen to me and let me explain to you the scientific proof of how this landoform takes on the label or identity of a face. Yes, I get it with the eyes, nose, mouth, and everything. It is very persuasive to looking like a face. Though it is not an actually face it is a nautural landform that takes the details and characteristics of a face.

I want to draw to your attention that when the face is spotted the shadows of the lanform project onto itself making if look like it has eyes a nose and a mouth. It is just crazy how science works sometimes. But if you just sit and think about it logically it makes sense. But yes, there was a great degree of surprise among our mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. It all came off quite strange. Though when we put it into scientific calulations, the result came back as a nautural landform. And that the eyes, nose, and mouth were just an illusion from the shadows.

Now after hearing all of the scientific calculations, proof, and resonings I hope that you understand where I am coming from. And the fact that it is just a natural landform. Also that it wasn't created by aliens or any other prehistoric creature that claims to live on mars for that matter. Thank you sir for taking the time to listen to my explanations. I highly apprectiate it. Have a wonderful day, and while you are at it I don't mind you sharing my theory with a few other people either. Thank you.   ",2
0b153d1,"For driverless cars they can have a plus side and a downside. I see that driverless cars can be a good thing for a few reasons. The posistive affects of the driverless car could range between keeping accidences from distractions down and for long trip safety. They can also have a downside. These downsides very from people who like driver to malfunctions in the car.

There are some positives to the driverless car. One of these reasons would be for the drivers that get distracted easily. The drivers wont have to worry about not being able to stay as focused since they will not have to drive. The driverless car can also keep drunk drivers from driving, preventing a big amount of crashes. There are also many more reasons driverless car can be a good thing.

Even with all the positives the driverless car will have some negative effects and problems. There will always be drivers who would prefer to drive and feel safer that way, in some cases they could be right. For instance, what if the computer in the car has a malfunction? What would happen then? Or what if the car will not switch to manual drive? These are some of the more important questions that would need to be tested and thought about. Driver want to feel safe, but can the put their faith in a computer?

Driverless cars can have their plus sides to safety. Though, with the positives there will always be the negatives and the questions. Will the driverless car function right, or will there be mistakes? I believe that no matter how much they try, there will always be a problem with it, but the driverless car can be a safe way of transportation.",2
0b1ab1d,Driverless cars may sound cool and less stressful but sound like they can put your life in alot of danger. Facebook twitter and social medias have troubles everyday so why dont you think your car would mess up and put you in danger from a little problem that its having. Driving on your own may be more safe than trusting technolgy to get you somewhere .Driving one of the driverless cars sounds like you can rest or just sit back and watch where you are going but what if you get in a crash and you didnt do anything the car did that might take alot of money out of your pockets for something you didnt even do. Cars that warn you when things are coming may be a good idea but what if one day they have a problem and dont tell you when something is coming and you run into someone money out of your own pockets once again to get car fixed and to fix the persons car you ran into. Cars that people control on their own may be the safest way to stay over the years until they get technology 100% right.,2
0b2c063,"The face on mars was made when the and on mars was made. Nobody can really say they know how the face got there. The reason why i say that is because nobody was there to make it or see who made it. No humans never lived there or was made there. NASA had sent out a Viking one spacecraft that was looking for a spot for the other Viking two to land. As the Viking was looking around it had saw somthing that look like a face and it took a picture of it and sent it to mission controllers. But the Viking one was not there when the face was first formed so NASA don't know how it got there or know how it was made.

NASA had never told nobody but the people that work there but after a coulple of days later they had showed the world what they had saw on mars. They had called it a ""huge rock formation that resembles a human head and mouth, eyes, and nose"". Some scientists belived that aliens made it and once lived on the planet mars at one time. All the people know is what they think or know what NASA told them how it got there. But really they dont know the date it was made, how it was made, what it was made with but all they know is what they got from a picture.

Know if some one frome earth was there and made it and was there to take picture's of them making it. It would have been a nother story then NASA can say that they know how it was made, what it was made with, what date it was made, and who made it. But they don't so they have to go off the picture that the Viking one took. They have to think how it was made, when it was made. ",2
0b35fa9,"First,The face NASA found in Mars is just a landform and I can prove it. On the picture on 1976 it actaully looked like a human face, but a human face cant be that big. On 1998 the eyes and mouth started fading away like it was disapearing. On 2001, you can't even see the face anymore.

Next, It looked like it cracked, also scientists 'figured it was just another Martian Mesa, comman enough around Cydonia.' But, also scientists believed the face was an alien artifact but, they can't prove that it is just what they believe.

Then,On April 5, 1998 it said that Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia to see if it was real. When they got there they took some pictures of it for JPL web site, but it revealed that it was just a natural landform and it wasn't a alien monument.

Finally , just to make sure on April 8, 2001 it said in the article that ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""""They rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. What the picture actaully shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landform common around the American West.

I believe that driverles cars are a genius idea because you can do anything while the car is driving. Well of course not everything you don't want to be sleeping and the car crashes onto something because it doesn't detect it. Many people run late in the morning on there way to work or school or wherever they might go and maybe didn't have time for breakfest or didn't finish getting ready

I believe that you can do that stuff while the car is in motion. Even though you need a driver there in the car ""Tesla is going to release a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time"" which means you'll only be driving that ten percent which isn't alot. Yes I do believe the safety of one another is very important but I think the manufactures wouldn't release a car if they knew it wasn't capable of doing the things that the manufactures promised.

Our everyday lives have been simplified from machines that have been designed to do our work for us. Something people use everyday are cars. So, is advancing cars the next step for improvement or will it be best kept as an idea?

Driverless cars has both pros and cons, but overall will do more harm than good. Car wrecks are very common and can happen to anyone. If we drive our cars by ourselves we feel as if we have more power or control over the car and its actions. A car designed to do the driving for you could be helpful in some ways, but would you want to put your all of your trust into a machine that has the power to take your life? Just like our cellphones and other everyday devices, they mess up. Failure in technology will always occur no matter how nice the product or idea might be. Although driverless cars will not fully be completly driverless. You still can have the ability to take over the driving, but then what is the point? People have been driving cars for years and years. It is better to not fix what is broken, than to adapt to a different lifesyle.

In conclusion, the future may be rising, but sometimes it is better to leave things the way they are. As time goes on, more advances will be added to cars to enchance the way we drive. Until then, a car needs its driver.",2
0b700a7,"Would you want somthing that reads your emotions and finds out weather you are happy, sad or depressed. If so read more to find out some more information about this device to see if you would want this at your job or school.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

In conclustion, i belive that this device should be in schools all round that United States. My reasoning is when people come in the school that system can do backround checks on parents or adults that come into the buliding. That makes sure they keep the school safe for teachers and students in the process of everyone else in the building at that time. Plus they can have data that will be saved for when they know when that person can to the school and left the school.        ",2

Of course not, it is natural to see something like this. It would be silly to think that food or a landscape on earth is an alien.

Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Once he got the pictures back it reaveled that it was an actual natural landform. We even went back on April 8,2001 to take another photo with a camera that had absolute maximum resolution. The picture had came back equivilant of a butte or mesa-landforms commonly found in the American West.

While taking these pictures, Viking 1 snapped an image of what looked to be a human face on a region of Mars called Cydonia. Since then, two other photos have been taken by Viking 1 in the years 1998 and 2001.

Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa but what made them a little uneasy about that soulution was the face that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The head was around 2 miles long from end to end and was formed by shadows that gave off the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Because of the human-like features that appeared in the photos, people began to believe that the ""face"" was hard evidence that there was some kind of human life on Mars. Due to the fact that some scientist believed that the face was an alien artifact and the picture was the topic of discussion in places all around the world, scientist had to work even harder to find out what the photograph actually showed.

Like many other planet most people would say we can't live in those types of conditions but scintist found out we could live on some planets and also grow food on some of those planets. So the author might think that it's worth finding out that if we could at least grow plants there since some plants can suvive and grow in real hot conditions.

Another posible reason why the author might would want to see if there is living life on Venus. Lots of people talk about there being more then just people on one planet so there could be some form of life on another. If we could grow food on some plants that could also mean that there's life on that planet too.

Also that antilockbrakes and drivers still seem to be a long way from the dream of calling drivers to take us wherever we may desire to go.

The drivers of the driverless car may get bored sitting and waiting for their turn to drive because there wouldnt even be a point in needing a driver if u have to sit and wait for your turn to drive. In the article it states "" The psychlogical aspects of automation are really a challenge, admits Dr. Werner Huber a BMW Project Manager Driver. Also what if the driver gets so bored from sitting around and waiting for his or her turn to drive and ends up getting into a car crash.

"" Antilock brakes and drivers assitance still seem a long way from the dream of calling drivers cab to take us wherever we desire.""

For example in the article it states that "" radar was a device on a hiltop cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack , So how driverless will these cars be in the near future?"" Futhermore can you imagine how much the driverless cars will be that can only cause more problems for not only everyone in the society that would like the car but also the manufactures of the car that may not make that much money because of how the expensive the cars may be.

the price range of the car mey be very hgh. Also how bored the driver may be sitting and waiting for there turn to drive. So not only in my opinoin but also in tour opinion how driverless you think these cars my maybe in the future?    ",2
0bee92d,"Dear Senator, the election is coming up soon and so is voting. The Electoral College and the popular vote get to select the president of the United States every year. I want this year to be a little different. This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president. The Electoral College knows all about thinking if the president is good enough for the country, and if he can be a good role model, or also a commander in chief. That is the reason why I would like to keep the Electoral College.

I would like the country to keep the Electoral College because they make good desiciosns, know if the candidate person is the right president, and last but not least they might think if the citizens would like this president based on his promises that he would like to keep. For example there are two candidates fighting to be president and it's time to vote and the Electoral College might look over? to see if the president looks like he can keep his promise to keep the coutnry safe, to make this a better country or not . That's what they look for in a president. That's the reason wwhy we should keep the Electoral College.

When the citizens want to vote for the president as well, they think of the same thing, if he's good enough for our country, and if he is going to keep us safe. The Electoral College knows a lot about picking the right president and they've been doing it for a long time.

""The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a? majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. That's enough electors to vote wether or not the president should be this person or that person.       ?       ???????????    ",2

I'm in favor of the Electroral college because ""the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense"". There are five reason's im in favor of the electrocal college, One reason is the certainty of the outcome you wont win if you have more popular votes but less electoral vote ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"".

The second reason is Everyone's President ""The electroral College? requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

In the 2012 elections Romney was popular in the south ""no incentive to campaign heavily in those states."" He doesnt have to have to campaign that much in the south because he knows those states will vote for him. The third reason is the Swing States ""The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012-to focustheir campaing efforts on the toss-up state."" Voters in the toss-up states have to pay close attention to the campaign because they're the ones that are going to decide the election . The forth reason is Big states, the bigger the states the more electoral votes they have and the presidential candidates pay more attention to those states ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in campaign than a small state does...""

The fifth Reason is Avoid Run-Off Elections ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..."" that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents.

The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States.

In the United states ,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called ""car reduced""communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this.    ",3
000fe60,"I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the ""face"" on mars. I will be explaining how the ""face"" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.

First off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.

Next, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?

Finaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the ""face"" is just a landform.

To sum all this up the ""face"" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.",3
002ba53,"Dear, State Senator

This is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.""There are many reasons to keep the Electoral College"" one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College because,it is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).

Another, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Last but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.

0033bf4,"What is the Seagoing Cowboys progam?

It was to help many countries that had been scarred by World War II.

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them.

People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRRA.

People should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys progam, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work.

It makes you feel good about yourself.

The article says, "" It made me more aware other countries and their needs.""

That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries.

Wouldn't that make you feel good?

In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going.

You could see Italy and other countries.

The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

That would be very exciting.

How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working?

You wouldn't have to pay for travel

While working for this program, you would also have fun.

The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals.

The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also the article even states that they played games.

Even though you are working, you will still have fun.

So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many different parts of the world.

Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

They helped many countries in Europe.

The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals.

So, do you think that you would want to become a Seagoing Cowboy?

Or at least be in the program.  ",3
0040e27,"There are many reasons why you should join seagoing cowboys program. You would be helping your country. You'd be traveling around the world. Last you'd have lots of fun over seas.

You'd be helping our country because when Luke was in seagoing cowboy program it was 1945 and world war 2 was happening in Europe and he had to those countries recover. Luke had to help the horses when the war was over to get people places and to work. If you were 18 or up you might be lucky and be drafted into the military service. The UNRRA would hire seagoing Cowboys to feed the horses cows and mules that were shipped overseas.

You'd be traveling around they world like Luke did. It took Luke 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast. You'd be traveling to China, Europe, Greece, and many more places. The only way you'd be good at this job is if you wouldn't get sea sick because if you are a seagoing cowboy told travel overseas a lot.

You'd have fun overseas if you don't get seasick. You'd have many adventures. You'd have many stories to tell your friends and family. You'd been in countries you'd didn't think you'd be in. You'd be able to play games in the countries you visit in the seagoing Cowboys program.

If you join the seagoing Cowboys program you'd love it. You'd be traveling. You'd be having fun. You'd be helping our country. So why don't you join our seagoing cowboy program. I bet you'd love to be in this program with all our helpful friends and family that want to try to help our country. ",3
00613e3,"The election should be by popular vote of the citizens not by government hired official with some group name to make them sound important.

The electoral colledge is just a way for the people running for president to get votes that they do not deserve. There are 538 electors in the electoral colledge and that means that that is 538 votes that may or may not have gone in favor of the person that the people wanted for president. Out of the 538 elecors they only need 270 votes to elect a president. Why not let the people (who go through tougher times than government officials) get the votes to elect the president. Each candidate that is running for president has their own group of electors who would rather vote for their candidate so they can get a big fat paycheck, instead of actually sitting down and trying to decide who is the most qualified to run this country. There are others who think like me too, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election instead of having suck up electors who don't even think about the people of the country. They do what they do best. Do you wnt to know what it is? They are suck ups for the candidate from their state (or to whomever has the most money).

There are some people who are going to say that the electoral colledge is a good way to elect our president and I understand that.

The electoral colledge might be a good thing because it consists of qualified government hired officials instead of everyday commoners like us. The electoral colledge was put into the Constitution so it must be worth something. Every state has their own candidate and with him are his electors, the best politicians that the government could hire for this job from that state. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the president and some people might be like HEY!, that is 270 votes that we dont have to do. The electoral colledge might also be a good thing for people who don't care about who runs the country.

If this country was founded on freedom, don't we have the freedom, no, don't we have the right to vote for who runs this country. Not suck up politicians. We should vote for our President!?    ",3
0065bd6,"Driverless cars should not exsist it can cause many accidents and possibly can result into death. I believe that driverless cars should not exsist because it can be dangerous to not just one person but for everyone.

Lets say you have a driverless car and sensors stopped working and you didn't know that, right there can cause a huge accident, just because the sensors stopped working.Or lets say you do get into an accident driving a driverless car who's fault would it be? We don't know. The text states in paragraph 9, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture?"" People need to know who's fault it would be if they are driving a driverless car and get into an accident and possibly get injured.

There is no point of having a driverless car if it is not completely driverless. In paragraph 7 it states that, ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" It also states that, ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" What if the person using the driverless car isn't paying attention to the notification sign, or what if a person falls asleep and didn't hear the notification sign then what?

In paragraph 9 it states, ""Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" I completely agree with that statement because with a driverless car what if it loses control you won't be able to do anything about it because you are not in control of it, but with a person driving,

that person has100% control of what ever happens.          ",3
006c931,"What if we could tell how all of the people us were without even asking. Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truely feeling. What then? Well new techonlogy can allow us to see exctly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secert.

The computer software works by making a 3-D computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technolgy delevopted by Dr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Dr. Huang obseres that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I htought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Dr Hoang also states that ""even though individuals often show verying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. or even why the are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benfits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Dr Huang was able to develope a computer that uses muscle movment to idenitfy emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepare and willing to ask why? ",3
0079938,"I don't like the idea of driveless cars. I feel like if a human can do it we should. Especially when it comes to things like that. like the idea of robots, would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care of older folks and children. I do think they are a good idea for the blind and people not going to far. Like since i live in Indiana, they would be a good idea for people in Indianapolis to get from the mall to like a resturant or something. Nothing major or far like driving from Indiana to California, not a good idea. I just don't trust things like that.

Driveless cars are sort of a good idea. they're are many pros and cons about the whole thing. I feel like they are dangerous because they could malfuncting and blow up or something. Or they will drive right into a buliding at full speed or something. No car is really safe in general, but letting a robot like thing drive your car is kinda a crazy idea. Another con is that they can't really drive by itself, it still needs you to hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident ot people working on roads. I feel like if they want to have driving cars they should just bulid a car that can drive people instead of a car that half does it. Another con is that they are basically illlegal in most states except a couple. Would we have to visit somewhere else to expericence what crazy technology the world has for us now. I also think they are a bad idea because driving are probably going to be directly on their phone, no hand on the steering wheel or anything. And like it says, when the car needs you to take over it will tell you to take over. But i feel like people will just ignore it and get into accidents they could have prevented.

Pros are that you can half drive. You wouldn't have to really pay attention to anything around you and you could just relax while driving. ",3
0081f18,"i think that having self driving cars would help alot. there are so many wreacks in the states because some people just dont know how to drive right.

so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind.

there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned.

although we would also have to make some new laws or change a few of them. like in the text it states that what if somone gets in a wreak in a smart car should the driver be blamed or the companies that sold the the car to that person beheld responcibale. there also still some improvements that have to be made before they can even start selling those cars .

those are the main reasons that i think making smarter cars is a great idea.",3

Not having to drive 24/7 would be nice, but at what price? Vehicles are not exactly the most reliable resource.

While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. They will go about thinking that the technology has everything under control. Forgetting that cars that require drivers have difficulties. Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building!

When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert.

Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own brain that allowes them to make the wrong or the right decission based on what they believe. Will you allow yourself to fall victim to awe or amazement and wonder at these new inventions. Or will you go over teh pro's and cons of becoming too reliant on the driverless vehicle and less aware of your actions while on the road? ",3

This advancment in computer software that can recognize human emotions and change the way we learn for the better .

Now take the software mentioned into a class room where it can make ""calculations"" about human emotion just as any other human does. The author, Nick D'Alto, says this ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" he also quotes a Dr. Huang saying ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused or bored."" Take these two quotes and you imagine a super computer that can learn what you take interest in and modify it's self to your liking. This would allow students to take charge in how they learn a concept.

This could be the next big things in learning since computers were first introduced in a classroom. That's not even the limit. This technology could be implimented in home schooled children and online classes as well. The reason being as Dr. Huang puts it ""it could modify the lesson...like and effective human instructor."" This means it would have the power to change lessons if you were not following or just confused. This ability can amplify the process of students learning online or at home.

In coclussion the technology being able to recognize human emotions will only improve the educational system. Being able to tell if a student is bored or confused on a concept will help improve many aspects in schooling. Being able to modify lessons on the spot just like a human insturctor is valuable. ",3

Venus is one of the most intresting planets near earth I think it would be intresting to study and so does NASA the text says, ""NASA is working on othe approaches to study Venus for example, some simplified electronics mode of silicon carbide have bee tested in a chamber simualting the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions"". See we could try and study Venus we could be on there for a 2 weeks and leave.

Venus is called the sister planet because of how close it is and like family Venus has the same looks aswhille the text says, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"". See if Venus is like earth we could look at what happened to it and make sure that doesn't happened to us.

Venus is a star we see at night have you ever wonder what it was? Or how it's like earth and has no life that is what NASA and so

many more space programs are trying to find out.

I think that the author is right that we should go study Venus even if it dangerus it's worthy of that risk. it a star and planet in our solar system. Venus is our sister planet and looks like us too, and NASA is finding ways for us to be able to walk on Venus and study it aswhile. ",3
00daaa2,"Pollution is one of the most dangerous causes in the world. However, people need the things that pollutes the air. Such as cars, body sprays,etc. I agree that the citizens should limit car usage.

Fuel is one of the causes that pollutes the air. According to the passage,""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" In addition to that, diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in france. Compared to a 53.3 percent average engines in the rest of western europe. Robert Duffer states that, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of global city."" Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Moreover, the same goes for odd-numbered plates. With that, the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party.

All the countries should try a car-free day. Andrew Selsky said, ""In a program that set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" Some of the advantages of having a car-free day can help make people see that its not about cars or bikes. Even so, Those things are just damaging the air and making it harder to live and breathe. Also stated in the article was that, "" It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by board, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Futhermore, it would help so people can see the world without cars and not pollute the air.

By giving some of the dangerous stuff that we use daily a break. We will see great turn outs and good things happen. Like, less traffic which means less accidents, less fuel used which means less pollution. Lets all help keep our country safe and clean. STOP POLLUTION!

how Venus is very similiar to Earth. The author states "" Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occassionally distance too.""(paragraph 2).The statement that the autghar made makes a good point because if Venus is the closest planet to been earth like than researching it would help us discover new thing. We can get resorces that we use in earth in this planet. Also the author states"" Long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported forms of life, just like Earth.

00f6383,"Lately there has been a lot of contreversy with ways to elect and which way is more effective and what is preferred by the majority of people. The problem with that is that many people are very biased when it comes to elections. Many poeple are raised with a certain way that their parents might have thought them was correct and that was how they were taught to elect. Although there is not a wrong way to elect, there are more effective and quicker ways to do it. I personally think that the best way to vote would be through popularity.

Electoral College is a ""compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."". Many people think that Electoral College is rubbish and complicated and I agree. According to paragraph ten in the passage the first sentence says "" Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" which means that it is more of a process to vote through this system. Instead of you inputing your opinion on who you would like to be President you are basically saying that you believe that this slate of electors have a better idea of who would be a better President.

The electoral college is known to be extremely unfair to voters. In paragraph thirteen the second sentence states ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" which is true because the slate of electors are obviously teams of people who root for the same candidate which gives independent voters close to no chance if they are not voting for the same candidate.

Overall I think that the electoral college way of voting is old and worn out and maybe its time that it went out of business and the popular vote takes its place. With the popularity vote not only do you get to have a chance of choosing the president without the electoral vote canceling out your vote but you also get to go around saying that you're part of the reason why your candidate won. Many people may disagree with me and say that my opinion is not a good opinion but from all of the statements that I have heard, I will still continue to believe that the popularity vote is the best way to vote.

Dispite those facts scientists are still fascinated by the planet do to it's increadible similarity to Earth, but the conditions have prevented scientists from investigating throughly. With all spacecraft sent to Venus being destroyed it is a suprise that we are still trying to study this planet, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gives very little insight into why scientists are still attempting to study the planet.

To start off Venus is our sister planet with very similar density and size to Earth with similar features with mountains, valleys, and other rocky structures. The author states that many scientists think that Venus could have supported life long ago and may have been covered in ocean and if this is true we may get much insight as to why Venus would change to become an exteremly inhospitable planet. Though the author gives us very little as to what we will be able to do with this information or what other information we may get. The author also mentions space travel but states only that, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crusial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" 4). Other than that small mention the author does not go into depth on this idea.

Though the thought of being able to explore and study one of the closes planets to us is great the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" does not do to good of a job of informing us as to why we would attempt to weather such harsh conditions. With the temperature going over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure that could liquify metal its hard to reason why we should attempt to send probes to Venus let alone travaling there personaly and the author does not do a very good job covincing us that this is a good idea. They give us very little information as to what they will get from this and give us information that makes this sound crazy to attempt. ",3

When the author's how human curiosity lead to dangerous endeavors is shown in paragraph 3 stating that the atmosphere is covered in highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds.

Another example is how exploration in venus is a worthy pursuit is in paragraph 2 stating ""... contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us."" shows the challenge in studying venus.

Lastly the astronimers fascination with venus is stemed from the fact venus has features simalor to earth.The author states that ""The planet has a suface of rocky sediment...features such as valleys, mountains, and crators."" show the simalaritis are still there.

The Facial Action Coding System will make the classroom more entertaining to all grade levels even in college, and the system will identify the emotions the user is feeling and will adjust the lesson plan to the students' liking.

The emotions are one of the only ways we can tell what each other are feeling but also thinking at the moment.

These days the only way that communicate mainly is through texting and most people don't like to call each other because people are becoming too caught up in technology to actually talk to the person they are trying to communicate with.

Also the people are becoming too lazy to actually call the person or actually go to the person in person and have their conversation with them.

In the education department of the government they are coming up with all these standardized test to prove that the student is eligiable to go to the next level of education, but in most of the schools in the United States who use these standardized tests most of the students fail the test and have to retake the test again the next year or semester.

With Professor Huang's creation of this tecnology the education system will be getting better and better tests results if this system is implemented into the schools all around the United States.

The Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because every child deserves a good education even if they are poor or don't have money to pay for the schooling.

The reason the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because the software will help students all grade levels succeed in the real world and have a good education and will help the student find good jobs once they graduate high school or college.

The Facial Action Coding System could actually help therapy patients and patients with PTSD and help the therapists, doctors, and counselors figure out what the patients are thinking or feeling at the moment.",3
01290ec,"Luke Bomberger is a who had started working in a grocery story and a bank, just when he got out of high school. Once he went on this trip to Europe with his friend Don Reist. Luke started enjoying going to oversea trips, even though he knew it would take a long time. Have you ever wanted to take an oversea trip? If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration. Its for SEagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything! Taking care of animals is another thing to, if you absolutely love animals than of course you might want to join. Especially if you are a farmer boy.

Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas. I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life. When Luke was on that trip he loved it, he first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended , on August 14th. On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger! Keep in mind that you can see animals , help people, and you can also visit places you have never visited in your whole life.",3

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" Also that Venus has ""familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and creaters."" But despite the belife that life was there, it's also that NASA and others are just curios of what they could find from Venus.

First, the author did a good job pointing out and bringing in the reader with Venus ""once have been most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago"" but he also goes and continues on how it was covered with ""oceans""

Secondly, the author tell's us that there are ""familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"" On Venus. This makes us want to pursuit the study on Venus despite the dangers it presents. Even with all the critical coditions Venus has, this example want's us to go and visit Venus.

Lastly, "" Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity."" Human curiosity makes us want to go to Venus and see what we can find and look. Most humans are very curios and when they find out there was once life in Venus, it makes us want to go and see what's out there. The author put this in to give us another reason why we should go out to Venus. He puts in ""human cruiosity"" to bring us in.

Finaly, from all of the eight paragraps I feel as if the author could have done a better job on their part to explain why it's ""worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" Also that the comparison between Earth and Venus was fine. But going to Venus and exploring and pointed out that there was once life in Venus gives a good example of going and exploring Venus.",3

There are positive and negative to have the driverless cars. They shouldn't develop driverless cars because drives still have to be alert, nobody wants to wait their turn to drive, and taffic laws say only a safe car is when a human has full control of it at all times.

The drivers that are in the car still have to be alert. The driverless car alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways. Also when they are dealing with traffic. Like roadwork, or accidents the driver has to take the wheel at those times.

Nobody wants to wait for their turn to drive. Driveless cars only let the drivers drive when they are in traffic or pulling out somewhere. Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive. Most people wont like the car being in control and not them.

Some laws are written with the assumption that the only safe about a car if a human has control of it at all times. Most states it's illegal to even test computer driven cars. There are some countrys that limited use of semi-autonmous cars but the manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as they know the cars are safe.

Driverless cars are good for someone people but most people would like to be in control when they drive. They shouldn't develop the cars if only some of the people like the cars and will use them.

015ac93,"Should venus be explored? There are many different aspects, and opinions on the subject, but the author gives us very good reasons why it should be explored and studied. One of the reasons is that belive it or not venuse is the most simalar planet to earth, also the scientist at NASA said they are working on a blimp like vehicle that could go up to 30 miles high. That means if they made this structer they could avoid all of the harsh conditions on ground level at venus such as the armospheric pressure, and the unbarable heat that is a crazy total of 800 degrees. If they would make this vehicle the pressure would drop substantionaly and so would the heat from 800 degrees to around 170 degrees, the solar power and radation would also be very plentiful and wouldn't exceed Earth levels. The conditions would definetly no be easy to deal with, but they would at least be survivable. There is one problem thought people at NASA can not document their finding because of conditions which would make it where cameras could not be used. This is because the most the light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher. But there maybe a solution, the thing is we might just have to go back in time. For example scientists are looking back on older technology, this technology would be mechanical computers, this is good because these computers do not requier any technology, they use gears and levers and would be substainable on venus. That is how the author suggests that the study of venus should be pursued. As it said in the artical dont look at it such as dangers just bigger challenges.",3
01665d5,"I think that the new facial action coding system would be good to read emotions of students because it could help figure out people's emotions t, it could help with mixed emotions, and it can help people with questions.

One way that the new new facial action coding system would be good to read emotions of students because it could help figure out people's emotions. One deatil to support my claim is that in the story it says "" for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face , of course most of us would have troube actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy or sad. That means that with the facial scan computer they acn do it with no hassle at all.

Another reason that the new facial action coding system could help is because it can tell if people have mixed emotoins. One reason to support is that in the text it says ""Dr Huang oberves thata artist such as da vinci studied how human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. That means that if someone is having mixed emotions the computer can detect the emotions that person is having.

My third reason that the facial acting coding system would be good is because it can hepl put a smile on people faces. One detain that supports my clain is "" According to the facial feedback theory of emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but can also help you produce them (Putting on a happy face).

In conclusion the facial action coding system would be good for people because it could tell if people have mixed emotions, it could help figure out people's emotions, and it can help people solve problems they are having ",3

""He envisions a future with public transportation system where fleets of drivelss cars form a public-transport taxi system. The cars he forsees would use half of today's taxis and offer more flexibilty than a bus."" (Paragraph 1) Integrating a transportation system would save people's money for a bus pass, or even someone's time.

Second reason why driveless cars would help society because driveless cars have good experience on the road. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" (Paragraph 2) Their has been very little accidents with driveless cars than there has been with humans driving cars.

Third reason why driveless cars are positive to the society is that the Google cars has many reasonable parts and technology to ""hold itself together."" ""Google modified Toyota Prius using position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof, Dubbed LIDAR.""

Driveless cars can be very helpful to society. However, traffic laws writes that with a assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Feedback from the Google cars driving before 2009 spectulates that,""So far, they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveway or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" (Paragraph 2) Driveless cars don't have complete control over the car at all times, so drivers must still be focused at all times.

018985d,"Identifying Human Emotions

Imagine being able to figure out exactly how anyone in this world are feeling with just a computer. Now software has developed that could help you do just that. The Fcial Action Coding System has applications that will be extraordinary to modern day technology.

Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman created the the FACS. All which have six emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are emotions that are used on a daily basis around the world so they are pretty basic. Video imagery is used that tracks one's facial movements. Therefore it can identify mixed emotions. The video imagery compares each expression with a neutral face in order to figure your emotions.

Imagine being at school on your classroom computer learning something boring, and all of a sudden the topic becomes fun. Dr. Huang predicts that your classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. It would be useful to many students in order to make and help them learn better. This same technology could make identifying emotions much easier. The boring lesson for you would modify. This way the computer will know to keep giving you boring lessons or fun ones.

Facial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work. Not only do your muscles express emotion, but they also help produce them. The article states that a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. This clearly would help the actors express themselves better, thanks to our face muscles. People may not notice, but we imitate other people's facial expressions with empathy.

Who would have thought that sience and technology could be involved with a big feature of who we are. Sometimes being able to figure how someone is feeling. At times we may even have to bug them in order to figure the emotion. Now with the new technology of FACS, this task will be easier. Even for students in a classroom, this will be valuable.               ",3
019e2c4,"Have you ever thought about what the world would be without cars? You're probably telling yourself how would I get from my house to the stores. Maybe you should try walking because cars tend to cause damage to our environment. We the people should try limiting driving because if we do we won't have pollution,we wouldn't have to deal with smog,and even better protect our environment. Greenhouse gas has reduced since automobiles were limited in the suburbs.

Limiting cars could have a great impact on reducing air pollution. Countries such as China are known as one of the most polluted countries due to th amount of gas it uses. A businessman Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""this identifies that people actually care about pollution. Pollution can also be bad for us humans because not only does it affect our breathing but it can also led to death due to the types of chemicals that we take in. Paris is a city who has dealt with smog and took care of the situation really quickly.

Smog is a major factor why people all around the world are either limiting driving or even banning cars with in the region. An example of that would be Paris who had were near a record day setting of pure smog. The effect of this led Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear air of the global city. Motorist were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer the consequences by getting fined 22-euros. This difference led to a congestion which went down to about 60 percent in the capital of France. Animals have suffered the most since cars started to evolve or became more useful.

The environment in which we live in has suffered consequences as well. Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency are stepping in to help out within the community. They started to propmote car reducing due to the 80 percent of approprations by law have gone to highways and the rest towards other transportations.

Now you see why we should start walking instead of driving because its good for our health but the main reason is that it limits driving. It also reuces pollution as well as smog, and keeps the environment clean. Are you willing to sacrifice your driving addiction for the sake of human kind and our animals.       ?    ",3

Many companies like GM and Google are working to create the driverless car.

They are working on improving the models that were already created, but these new care could lead to bad events.

Because of the lack of human attention, computer errors, and new liability questions driverless cars should not be developed.

Sitting in the driver's seat of a driverless car, may cause more issues than benefits.

According to the article, ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

In order to drive. the human can not be distracted by phones or food, but with the idea of being in a driverless car, the human will be.

In self-driver cars, people are distracted by their phones, even though they must pay attention to road.

The distracions will be more dangerous in driverless cars because as the article states, ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. When people enter the new cars, they will believe that they do not have to pay attention because the car is driverless.

When the car malfunctions, the person is the car would be so distracted that even with devices to get the driver's attention, he or she would not be able to react quickly enough.

The extreme lack of attention would cause accidents, injuries, and deaths.

Driverless cars are run by sensors, hardware, and software.

In many cases, these items are known to crash or suddenly stop working.

A computer crashing can lead to bad events and having that computer crash while driving a car would make the events twice as worse.

The brakes may stop working, the car might steer itself off the road, or it could even steer into another car.

If humans have no control over the car, they can not try to steer the car the other way when it crashes.

People would believe they are invincible with the new cars, but techhnology is know to fail.

When technology fails, the driverless car would get into some crash.

With the crash, liabiltiy questions would erupt.

The article states that ""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""

The person in the driver seat would want to blame the car and the company that created it.

The car company would want to blame the person for lack of attention.

According the the article, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.""

This creates more trouble for state governments.

Driverless cars seem great innovative with the idea of not having to ever drive again.

Although there is real danger that accompanies driverless cars.

With the thought of the car being invincible, humans will be less alert.

When the system goes down, people would not be able to react in time.

The people who do not react in time would cause accidents and blame the car companies.

The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This evidence from the article shows that these driverless cars are safe. There are multiple crashes a day with regualr human driven cars. With these driverless cars humans would be much safer. The text also states, ""Google cares aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver..."" This shows that the car is not fully driverless, but this may help to keep the driver alert. This helps whoever is driving stay more alert while on the road.

According to the text, ""For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" This illustrates how the company will add many sensors to the driverless car. They want to make the car as smart as possible. This text shows that they are trying to copy the skill of a human driving a car.

One example from the text is ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."" This proves that the driverless cars can do many things. It goes to show how many good qualities the driverless car has. There are many more things about this car that are very helpful when it comes to driving.

Many people may say that driverless cars are a negative thing. All of this evidence from the text clearly states that they are very positive. They may say they are too expensive or that they are not completley driverless. The company is not done constructing these smart cars. They are hoping to become fully driverless. There are very few negative aspects about the driverless car.

There are many positive things about the driverless car. The development of these cars is going to have a positive effect on many people around the world. These cars will help

01ae85f,"Dear State Senator, I am feeling the need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes for the president of the united states. I feel this way for three reasons. The first reason is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.

The first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the Electoral College still has it's defenders. That was the first reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The second reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes, is because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, butr for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So the Electoral College usually wins since the votes go in to the House of Representatives first, which is really unfair to the other people that are doing the election. That was the second reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The last reason why I think that they need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes, is because at the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair nto voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. But it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arrguments in favor of it are mostly asserstions without much basis in reality. That was the last reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

State senator i'm writing you this letter so you can hopefully change the Electoral College to election by popular votes. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. so the only last words that I have to say to you are: Abolish the Electoral College!    ",3
01bd69c,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe she was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what she really felt in the painting. All we know is what we see today and thats her smiling.

01c1169,"Anyone and everyone has emotions. There are many different ways a person can feel and how they could express those feelings. But now, there's actually a way a person can ""calculate"" someone else's emotions. Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe, are now developing ways for humans to communicate with computers. To be more exact, they're looking for students to try out this new software. There are many reasons why they should try out this new and exciting innovation in technology.

The most important reason why they should use this software in schools is to see how the student is feeling at school. School is a very interesting and complex place. It can effect students in many different ways for the good or the bad. That is why this software is so important. In paragraph 6, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" As we all know, school can be very boring. This very reason is why an abundance of students aren't doing good in there classes. Administrators could use this information about the students to adjust there learning programs to make the lessons more interesting for the students. The computer can even go beyond classroom problems to mental health issues. School shootings have been a major problem recently and if a computer can detect a student's unhappiness, the school could stop the problem before it even happens.

All in all, this new computer software could help boost student's grades, make learning more interesting, and could even help save lives. ",3
01c46fa,"The article called "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes how a new technology called the facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Here you will find an arguement on whether or not the use of technology to read is the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Students using technology is a great way for them to express themselves. Once students understand how there technology works they will began expressing themselves through culture, Litilarcery, and so much more. In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it says "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This allows some computer software to recognize emotions.

Facial expressions are a very important detail in every individuals life. Reading someones facial expression can tell you what you need to do next. For example in paragragh 4 it says "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, "" even though individuals oftem show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly)."" So when your friends mad and doesnt want you near her or shes just confused, now you'll know your next step.

Emotions are not just expressions on ones face but body movement as well. Body Language plays an important roll in facial expressions. In paragragh 3 it tells us ""Eckman has classified six basic-emotion shappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movents of the facial muscles."" For example when your angery your orbicularis oris which is the place around your mouth, it tightens your lips up to show your emotion.

The use of technology to read emotional expressions are very important. It not only tells us our emotions but our body language as well. This allows us to tell what another person is feeling rather than ask them.",3
01c5073,"My views on technology being used to read students emotional expressions is, that I am against this idea in certain cases. I feel like this could go agaisnt someones privacy and the way others can view them in certain different ways they did before. I don't believe that people should use technology to figure out if someone is feeling sad, happy, angry, confused etc.. because it is there privacy and not for anyone else to know unless you tell them so.

Another reason I can give is that the technology is almsot pointless when we can do this ourselves, they say it themselves ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the simple look on their face"" The technology isnt needed when we can do this with our very own two eyes, The point of the techhnology is to give an accurate hypothosis of how we are feeling when we can give that just by talking to someone. There has been times where I've been texting people and know what there emotions is like just by texting them, when we get to know someone well enough we can sense if something is bothering them. This technology on the other hand takes that part of building a relationship with someone to a lower level, you would already know their emotions even in the classroom.

The last example I have is the fact that people can fake there emotons and people do it all the time. It is a tendency and human nature to put on a mask to hide if we are sad or hurt by something because at times we dont wanna hurt people. We could hide the way we feel all we want, because the computer doesnt know whats on the inside, it knows whats on the outside, which in another example in the first sentence saying ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" That is an example of the Leonardo Da Vinvi's ""Mona lise"" the question I have is how do we know thats how she actually feels? He doing a portait not telling her to show how she really feels while he paints. What I am getting at is, it is easy to put on a mask when everything does feel okay.

In conclusion, I don't think this technology is a bad idea, but I feel like it is not needed when we can figure it out just as much the computer can, just maybe not as on point so to speak, but it is someones privacy and not anyones elses unless the person chooses to say.",3

01d6e7e,"The 'Face' on Mars is just a hoax. It seems as though the mound on this planet is just a mesa. If you don't believe me, then listen to me very closely. The very similar face on the side of Mars can be very defining but not a single astronout have researched at the Mesa up close and personal. But even if it was made by aliens, it still wouldn't tally up right?

The 'Face' was first noticed in 1976 by Viking 1 spacecraft, circling around Mars, after trying to find its sistership, Viking 2. As Viking 1 was circling around, it spotted a likeness to the human face. And the mound was found in Cydonia, a very well-know area on the Red Planet to house mesas. As the years went by, they looked more into the mound and Scientists concluded that it was just another mesa, but this moutain-like hill had shadows that resemble the human face.

As you review this very peculiar picture, you can see that it just resembles Earth, mostly in Western America. That certain part of America are very popular for its mesas and buttles (which are the same as mesas). There may be more out in the solar system, mnaybe even more in the whole universe itself, but in the end of all the discoveries, they all end up being coincidences. Maybe one day, we'll find extre terrestrial life, but for now, we will just make more and more discoveries until we don't have anything else to find.",3
01ec06b,"Dear State Senator ,

The electoral college is not a good idea. Voters really dont get to vote for the President . A slate of electoral is the person to elect the President. This system is called a disaster factor , the U.S. should be lucky the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. There are also people that want to stay with keeping electoral college . The electoral college restores most of the weight on the political balance that by population in large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. The canidates dont spend time in the states they know theres nochance of winning. Its a winner takes all kinda thing. In the 2000 campaign about 17 states didn't get to see there canadidates at all . States like Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campaign ad.

Here is some information on the electroral college ,Every 4 years the presidential election is held on the Tuesday after the first monday inNovember. You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President . When you vote your actually voting for your candidate's electors. The electoral college has 538 electors. 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. After the election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertinment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning canidate in your state.

State legislatures are responsible for picking electors. In the 1960's segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratice electors with new who would oppose John F. Kennedy.? in 1960 also Hawaii sent in 2 slates of electors to congress . Luckily , Vice President Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate validated his only opponet's electors.

The electoral congress should not be used it's unfair . It should be changed to be the popular vote for the president in the U.s. . It's unfair to the people there not really voting.       ?       ??       ??       ?    ",3
0200fbc,"The story "" The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" was all about venuse. The story explained that Venus is

dangerous, it's not safe for people to go up to Venus and they are thinking about sending technology to Venus.

Venus is very dangerous. In the story it say that ""venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". That is not good imagine a (NASA) researcher going to venus to get information they would not even make it back because of how hot it is. Venus is something were people should not go. Also in the text it says that ""Venus would not allow scientists to float above the fry"". That quot from the text is very important because it is clealy warrning you that it is dangerous.

Venus is not very safe for humans/researchers. In the story it says that "" beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seekinhg to land on its surface"". Just reading that littke sentence you can tell Venus is no joke it is very dangerous. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration would not even send a human to study Venus.

In the story the author talked about sending mechanical computers to Venus to get the information they need. That would be very smart to send old technology

(Mechanical computers) insted of humans it would be way safer. In the story the author states that ""These divices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"".

So I belive that if these mechanical computers did the job back in 1940s then it can do the job now because we have better technology no then we did back then. Also it states in the story that ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicaye when it comes to extrem phisical condidtions"". If they send these computers they can really get their information andit would save more human lives because then the humans would not have to go to Venus toget the information they need.

In conclusion Venus is dangerous, its not safe for humans to go up to venus and they are thinking about sending tecnology computers to get information.",3
021271e,"In the article it states that a "" Long time ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today ."" This shows that Venus wasonce probably just like how earth is today . You couldve probably lived there and made a whole new life there . Also the text says "" The planet has a surfave of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This shows how Venus is just alike to earth and that maybe we should consider exploring Venus more.

The idea in the article that they came up with is that they wanted us to imagine a ""vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles abover the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level om Earth."" This is showing that humans can possibly live on Venus . Its not ""eady conditions"" to live in but they can. They should explore Venus some more and come up with a idea so people can possibly start a life there. This would benefit a lot of people because what if something really bad happened to earth then people could stay on another planet and we can have Venus as a back up plan if anything goes wrong .

In conclusion, NASA should consider exploring Venus because its would benefit a lot of people. Having another planet to live on would possibly lower the population on earth and would make it easier for everyone. It can also be a ""backup planet"" incase anything happened to the planet earth and lastly we can see how it is to live different as surive in a different planet . ",3
0220c9f,"This article about the Facial Acting Coding System could be valuable. Though it may not be exactly needed it could be used when looking at a criminal and seeing what emotions they are hiding under the fake smile or crying face they have. This facial coding system could be used to help students who are struggling and what help but cant get the nerve to ask for it. Since technology is becoming a way of life this is just another step forward to becoming closer to computers and for them to understand us better.

In paragraph 1, It showed an example of Mona Lisa. In paragraph 5 it talks about how Da Vinci would study human anatomy to help him paint facial muscles precisely to show true emotions. For them to do Mona Lisa was brilliant because everyone knows who she is and Da Vinci studied human anatomy to show strong emotions. This could be valuable to schools because students make it hard for other students to show their true emotions. By using this facial coding systen teachers and administration could see what students are truly struggling with. It could be their math homework or maybe a problem with family. They could see their emotions in the computer while at home and at school to see how they act differently. This system could make school a more welcoming and fun to place to come to. In paragraph 6 it says this computer technology could make a boring lesson more interesting to the specific student. Every student has different like so this would be very valuable to schools.

Through this all it would be valuable for schools to invest in this product because it would make the school more fun for students and allowing them to learn more by the facial system allowing them to recognize what makes them happy and what makes them annoyed or bored. It would also be valuable to buy this because students could have fun learning about it and seeing how it works and may show them what they want to do in the future by showing what the future may turn out to be with new technology.",3
0226c11,"The face on Mars is a natrual landform created on the planet. Some people believe it was created by aliens or that's an alien artifact around the planet. The face that we see in the pictures is mostly not possible for aliens to create and for sure there are no tracks of any alien life around.

In the article it says There was no alien monument after all. This explains my answer by saying that the face was created naturally and not an alien artifact. Also in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars it explains another reason to show that the face on Mars is just a natural landform created by the planet in the article it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa！landforms common around the American West"". This also explains my answer by comparing the natural landforms on Earth and comparing it to the face on Mars. The third reason to explain why the face on Mars

is a natural landform is in the beginning a reason to why people think it's an alien creacted landform or artifact is because of the pictures where not made clear enough during 1976-1998. After getting the 2001 picture it's easier to see that it only creates a face when there are shadows.

The picture taken in 2001 can also make it clear that it has a natural form for example it's not perfectly shapped and it has a few cracks almost like a rock. In the article it says ＾As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". This explains my answer by explaining how the image taken in 2001 was a better picture of the face on Mars and they could actually work on it better and discover it without any problems to stop them along the way. Also the image taken in 2001 can help explain to those who believe that it was formed by aliens that it was a natural landform created by the planet naturally. The landform that looks like a face on Mars is created naturally by the planet. ",3
022d72e,"Have you ever wanted to become a hero? Have you wanted to help people through tough times? Well I know the job just for you! A Seagoing Cowboy. My name is Luke and I was a seagoing cowboy. One day my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I knew I couldn't resist the opportunity. It was 1945 and World War II was all over Europe leaving cities in ruins. Luckily, many nations came together to help support Europe. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped overseas. My friend and I both signed up.

We joined the group because we knew it would be an experience of a lifetime. We also wanted to help people and animals in need. It felt so good to be able to be called a hero. You also get to see many countries and their landmarks. They give you freetime to go and explore the city or town. You learn so much from the cultures and the different people who live there. Although it takes a lot of time, it is definitly worth the trip. You are so proud of yourself for helping people and animals. There is a lot of work involved and you have to be willing to do it. In the end though, it pays off.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy opened up a whole new world for me. It was definitly an adventure that I will never forget. It made me more aware of people and their needs. My family hosted a number of people from all over the world. It brought a new light into our eyes. We now know that not all people have what we have. We learned that we need to stay humble no matter how much we have. So go ahead, see what new adventure is waiting for you as a Seagoing Cowboy.      ",3
024873e,"Many elections have gone bad in the United States. Just like wat it says in ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wong"", there were many ""disaster factors"" in the system during elections. Also, delegates in the electoral college don't even vote for their own party's canditate, they just fool around and choose the other candidate. We should abolish the electoral college and change the election by popular vote.

To begin with, there were many ""disaster factors"" in the system for the electoral college. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the Best-Laid Defenses of the Systems Are Wrong"", it states that back in 1960, segregationists almost succeds in putting in new electors to oppose John F. Kennedy. Also, it states that there are ""faithless"" electors that refuse to vote for their party's candidate which is pretty sad. There are more reaons why we should bann the electoral college.

Furthermore, population is a big factor also in the electoral college. ""In Defense of the electoral college: Five Reasons to Keep Our Despised Method of Choosing the President"" It states that the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance of large states. It's wrong because the big states are the ones that need that population in order for the candidate to win. It's pretty fair to do it by popuation because it depends on that specific person on which candidate is gonna win, not by the state.

That leads to the fact that electoral votes are not the same as voters voting for the president. Many presidents lost the election just because of the electoral college. Personally, it's not fair that a candidate can't become president just because of the electoral college. it even says it in ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wong"". It states that voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors that will elect the president. Nobody knows if that person is loyal or not.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be banished from this country. It is a terrible system that had many ""disaster factors"" in it and also there are people that are elected that are not loyal to their party. If we don't stop it now, who knows what will happen to this magnificent country. If we keep the electoral college as our system, maybe our country will go downhill, so r you willing to abolish it for the greater good?    ",3
0264158,"In the article,""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there is an abdunant amount of reasons why these cars with the idea of driveless cars is absolutly absurd. The idea for the car itself is a ton of money just to build it. Then to add ""smart-roads system""(3) would add thousands of more dollars to go to waste. If the money issue is not a concern, then what about the idea of still having to assist a car that is suppose to be ""driverless""?

The cars themsevles would cost a fortune to make but ""smart-roads systems""(3) would cost too much money for anyone person to pay. Now the car itself would be too much money because of the need of so many sensors. With an estimated guess, there would have to at least 11 different types of sensors to be place in one car. Even with thousands of dollars going into the driverless cars, they still have not found a way to have a completely driverless vehicle. Different cars call for different driver's assistance. Some ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel,""(7) while others will send a signal to the driver such as, vibrating the seat, announcing to driver that they ""should be prepared to take over""(7), and others have flashing lights. Which means that in no way is this car driverless if it some how requires the drivers help with driving.

These cars would cost one person, a lot of money that they do not have. Even the safe-road system that has not even been made would cost even more then the car itself. If that was not enough, then what about the fact that these cars are not driverless... the driver still needs to help driving. These reasonings just help with the understanding that these cars is just something that is not needed in this world.",3
0269b85,"The picture shows a face but how long ago was that picture taken, 1976 was when the first picture was taken. In 1976 they had a camera with pixels thats not so good. The picture was taken like there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gound or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were. It was taken 43 meters away.

In 1998 the picture was taken again and the camera was getting better and better. The 1998 picture looks more clear then the pitcure that was taken in 1976. Over time the picture got more clear. 2001 the picture was taken again and it was taken 2.5 km-wide stripes away. This time it didnt even look like a face. The Middle Butte looks like a snake from in the air but doesnt make it a snake. You saying aliens made that too the way the water moved made it like that .

So facts show that at one point it looked like a face but wasnt done by alien the way the picture was taken is the reason why. You could use the moon as an example. Everyone use to think there was a man in the moon just by the way it looks but clearly there isnt a man in the moon.

0273b7b,"Venus is often referred to as the ""twin"" of earth. It is the second closest planet to the sun. Space crafts have been sent to Venus despite its extreme conditions. There has not been any humans sent to Venus. The last spacecraft was sent was three decades ago. Spacecrafts have not lasted more than a few hours after landing in Venus.

The author of this article suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Astronomers and scientists are fascinated by Venus because it is the most similar planet to Earth. In the article it states that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus has some features that are the same to those of Earth. Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters. Mars and Venus are the closest planets to earth and often times Mars is closer than Venus. Due to the speed, it changes which two planets is closest.

NASA is working on technology that would allow further studying on Venus. One of their solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. This means that they would have something that could fly over the many storms to avoid the bad conditons. This idea is more thought out than the spacecrafts that would have to land and would only last a few hours. Another one of NASAs projects is simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

The author does have some convincing details in the article. Though the conditions of Venus do seem harsh and there has not been anymore attempts to send more projects down to Venus in three decades. It does seem like NASA is working hard to get things fixed and ready for a possiblity of sending projects down. The details presented were convincing and it makes a good article. The author is pursuading but the conditions that Venus holds are not convincing.       ",3

0293f31,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great achivement in science and technology, but should it be used in your computer at school? There are many reasons why using this coding systam could be a great thing in the class room, or a disaster. As stated in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if we could put this in our everyday school computers, it could calculate whether or not a student is having trouble with a lesson and change it for them to help them. What are the pros? What are the cons?

Some of the pros to using this coding system in students computers is as stated in the article, it could read the studens facial expresssions and determan if he or she is confused or having trouble understanding the lesson. If it could do this it could change the way the lesson it tought better helping the student understand.

But what if schools dont teach lessons online. For example, my school does not teach lessons online. Our teachers might give us website addresses to look up and use for studying, depending on the teacher. Unlike other schools around me that do E-learning. They either stay at home, or go to school and do a whole days work off of their school issued computers. This Facial Action Coding System would work greatly for those students that do E-Learning, but not so much for the ones that don't.

Secondly, does this system cost anything? If so how much? And do schools really need to spend extra money on a system to be installed in our computers? Schools have gotten along just fine without this for years. Schools did just fine before they were even using technology like computers in the first place. I don't think that we are really in need of something like this. Students using the internet to do assigments always ask questions if they have any. Those students also have internet acsess if they are working on online assignments, so they could also search for more websites to help them better understand.

Another topic listed in the article was using the coding systam to learn if that person was intrested in an add that showed up on their computer or not. I belive that adds are already annoying enough, I do not want a coding systam reading my face and giving me adds that I would be more intrested in. Doing so would distract that person from trying to get their work done. For example, if I was a student scrolling through a website I am using to fill out an assignment for school, I don't want a bunch of adds poping up distracting me from my work. Espesially when its and add that intrests me. If its something that intrestes me, then I'm more likely to click on it distracting me from my work. I sertanly wouldn't want that to happen, and I belive nobody else does either.

Really there are a lot of great points to both sides of the topic, but it is mainly up to the schools if they want to use The Facial Action Coding System or not. They only need to ask themselfs the right questions. Do our teachers teach offline alot? Do we have the money for technology like this? And do our students really want to use this or not?                ",3
0296469,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the aouthor presents two both possitive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In which i found that a driverless car would not be a good idea. I found this to not be a well thought out plan due to the technology could fail, the cars can't navigate through work zones or around accidents and human drivers would eventually get bored of sitting there and doing nothing and would want to eventually drive.

First, thing that would be on anyones mind about being in a car that you can not fully control is what if an accicdent was to accour or the car's systems began to fail? Who would be blamed the driver or the company that produced the car? In the article the author states that ""...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fualt- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This proving that when the laws are changed the person whom is at fualt may not at all be fair since it could have been the manufacturer's fualt and not the driver.

Second, reason why driverless cars would not be all the great is because the cars can not navigate throught work zones and accidents, so what goood would a driverless car be when it can not even navigate around everyday issues. In the story it states ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This showing hwo the driverless cars won't be complettely driverless which would then compleicate things for certain drivers and, or the manufacturers in case of a navigation error.

Lastly, drivers would eventually get bored of just not doing anything and would want to drive but would not be able to because there cars would be self driven. Inthe article on paragraph 8 it states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?..."" This evoctaing how not only would you get bored while waiting since you can do other things while in the car if you have to drive and you are doing somthing which you can't automaticlly take over it could cause and accident and it would not be at all safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea due to the fact that the technology could fail and then who would be at fualt may be a problem or simple unfair. The cars can not go through work zones or accidents so why would you want a driverless car that you still have to drive in case of something like that. Thirdly, drivers would be bored waiting for there turn to drive and if they were to do something else and could not automaticlly take conrol that could cause issues for themselves and other drivers. So why would you want a self-driven car when driving so such so much more fun and better?   ",3

And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

'It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover thier food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).' As stated in paragraph 2.

'UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.' As stated in paragraph 2. Luke had made nine trips in two years of ""service."" Luke says in paragraph 5 that ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured am excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China

You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go. 'It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.' Luke had slipped down a ladder and broke a couple ribs, so, he could not do very much heavy work.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gmaes also helped pass the time.'

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun! It sounds like if I were one I would be pretty amazed and entertained. It opens up the world to you.

I got to see the Acropolis in Greece! They were made to honor the Greek gods and are on a big hill, above the whole city. It was wonderful. Although, the gongola ride in Venice, Italy was probably my favorite. It was like a mini cruise in the city streets!

I loved helping out with the animals on the ship. The slippery ladder scared me, but it was totally worth it. Don't break your ribs on the way down like I did. Ouch.

But I do believe that it can go farther than just the class room, the school counclers can use this to tell if someone is having issues or just a bad day. If the student is upset or angry, the counclers could help them by just knowing how they feel. It can also allow the resource room teachers to better understand how their students are feeling and how to help them.

This could help teachers ease up on the work load given to students by showing them how stressed some students are when given a lot of homework, and it can tell teachers when a student is not paying any attention. This can rebuild the relationship between students and teachers by allowing teachers to better know their students needs and limits, as in how much homework they can efficiently get done with out stressing about it. This can also help teachers push back tests by knowing who isn't getting it, or having less things on it because the students are understanding the materal.

I honnestly believe that FACS really is valuable when reading the emotional expressions of students in the class room by; telling the teacher who needs help, also telling the teacher who is board and how stressed the students are, by telling the resourceroom what their students are feeling today and how to adapt to that, and by helping the counclers by showing them who needs to get something off their chest.

I really do believe that this will auctually help students and teachers in the very near future.",3
02da02a,"Being an Seagoing Cowboy is amazing. You can do and see many exciting things just going to your destination. You can help people in need when you get there, when on your way to help others you can visit places that you haven't visited before, and when your a Seagoing Cowboy you can have a varity of things you can do.

First off, you can help people in need. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you help people that just came out of war, so they need help to get back on their feet. When you get there can be assigned a person you can help and hel them. The person your helping can be very nice, you might even become friends with them. Besides, they fought for your country, at lease helping them would be nice.

Secondly, you can visit many places you haven't seen. Have you ever wanted to go some where but didn't have the time to, well becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you can. For example, when I was helping people I got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also, visited Venice, Italy on my to China. One more place I visited was Panama Canal also on my way to China. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy gives you the once in a life time opportunity to see and go places where you might never get to go again.

Last but not least, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you can have a varity of things to do. When I was on the boat I was assigned to help my aunt Katie on her farm. Then on my second trip I served as night watchman. I had to look after the animals make sure they were doing okay. I played many games to. Bsaedall, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, and reading, whittling just to name a few.

In summery, be an Seagoing Cowboy can be very fun. You can do fun stuff you like to do, you can visit places that you haven't seen, and you can help people in need. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy just might be the best thing you posibly can ever do.",3
02f131c,"This face on mars? Not exactly a sign of aleins. We can prove it. How you might ask? Well its simple if it were made by inteligent creaters would it probably still be ther. Well yes it would. Unless it were like a carnival and it travled around. But it was a giant rock. In this paper im going to prove to you that this face was not made by ""aliens"".

Twenty five years ago we found what looked like a face on mars. We didnt know if this were something caused by aliens or just something that was natural. Well that was untill we came back to take more pictures of this so called ""face"". We came back around twenty two years later. Just to find out we caught the face at the right time when we took the first picture. We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.

But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.

So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time. We realeased it so we could sow you guys we may have found something. Now we have proven that we didnt find anything. We can also tell you the ""Aliens"" didnt destroy anything because this rock is still there.

This artilcle was givin to you to prove that aliens didnt cause this ""face"". We know that there are no aliens on mars. Here in 2016 we have rovers up on mars we know nothing is up there. I was using the article to prove my theroy up above. and how could you think that a giant face is caused by aliens? People. I dont know what goes through there mind sometimes.

0302537,"I am for the development of driverless cars. I think it would be cool if we had cars that did the work for us. They are just like smart phones in a way. However I don't think we should completely have no control over the car. People may start thinking that they can do whatever while the driving is in progress. That is not the case. Drivers should still pay attention to the road as if they were normally driving. Driverless cars will benefit us in a positive way.

One reason why i am for driverless cars is for the disabled people who can't drive like others can. Those people deserve a way to get around town too. Another reason why i think having driverless cars is a good idea is because of the simple fact that it is an option. People can buy a driverless car but still take over if they want to or need too. Another good reason for having driverless cars is for long distance drives. Sometimes flying a plane to a far destination is too expensive but if a car could take people long distance to where they need to go without themselves having to drive such a long way it would be more easier for themselves. The only concern with driverless car would be ""Who is at fault"" but that could be easily depicted i'm sure.

Driverless cars would benefit us greatly. It shows no harm to anybody who would like to have no driver. For all the reasons previously stated it is a good idea to have driverless cars. After all, it is our decision to make whether or not we want to have driverless cars. ",3
030cf8b,"In as small of a community as the Florida Keys, it is harder than it seems to unify us. yes we have sandbar sunday and woofstock but what else could we do on a daily basis that could unit us? As a community, if we were to limit car usage it would unit the community, decrease polution, and decrease the ammount of stress oon people. Making our community better is just one small step to making the world a better place.

Living in the keys, we all know that when the snowbirds come down traffic builds up to where it is not even moving. If we were to limit the car usage and say that on Mondays, Wensdays, and Fridays you had to either car pool or use public transportation it would unit us as a community. According to Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times Company,this year in Bogota, Colombia the city of 7 million went a day with out cars to promote alternative transportation(Selsky, paragraph20). Selsky also taked about how two other cities joined in, Cali and Valledupar,and how they helped generate a revolutionary change(25-26).Also according to Elisabeth Ronsenthal, a New York Times writer,"" ...The Internet makes telecomuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet forends""(Ronsenthal, paragraph 35).This just goes to show that no matter how big or little your community is, a day without cars might just be what you need to unify your community.

Along with beautiful clear waters, we also have our share of polution lingering in our mangroves and in our bay. Polution can be anything from a peice of garbage to smog in our air that is slowly suffocating our native plants. Even though down here we dont have a lot of smog, we still have to be awear of it and what it is doing to our neighboring communities. According to Elisabeth Ronsenthal,from the New York Times, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States""(Ronsenthal, paragraph 5). Also according to Robert Duffer,from the Chicago Tribune,""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city""(Duffer, Paragraph 10). If we want to keep our beautiful water clean we should consider going to a limited car use schedual.

Lastly, by chosing to inforce a limited car use day it would decrease the stress in our community making it even more like paradise. According to Andrew selsky,""'It's a dood opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife(Selsky, paragraph 24). Also other sientist have proven that daily excersise can reduce stress levels caused when a hormone is relised while you excersise.

In conclusion, by reducing or limitincar use for a day you can unify your community, help decrease polution, and decrease your stress levels.       ??    ",3
0318358,"Driverless cars would be cool, but they're not safe enough to have around. The drivers have nothing to do, the driverless feature in the car could get messed up, or even the things that alert the driver that it's their turn to drive. There are so many dangers to having driverless cars, this is just a few.

For example when all the driver has to do is sit there, it will be takenadvantage of. People could fall asleep at the wheel and not be able to take over the driving when they're needed to. A lot more messing around would occur so the driver would not be focusing. Drivers need to stay focused on the road so everyone can safely arrive to their destination.

Never know when the driverless feature could have a glitch or break down. Cars break down all the time, what's any different about the cars systems? Nothing, these cars could have been manufactured incorrectly. The GPS could also stop working or hit a glitch and you could end up 20 miles away from where you want or need to be.

Imagine. You're in your driverless car, somethings coming up that you need to take over for, but you're just talking away and having a big jam session with all your friends. Your car means to alert you but the system is broken, the car keeps moving but it thinks you're driving, you hit a construction worker. Now you have a huge fine to pay plus you have to get your car fixed.

With these new driverless cars their drivers aren't going to be paying enough attention, your car glitches out, or you're to busy having a jam session with your friends. So many things could go wrong. These cars would be teaching the youth they don't need to pay attention, the car will do it for them. All in all driverless cars are not safe and should not be developed.",3
031bbb0,"Do you think this ""face"" was created by aliens? I think not because this ""face"" was not created by aliens but created by a natural landform. Landforms happen all the time, just because it happend on another planet doesn't mean aliens did it.

In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it ""huge rock formation"" . Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says ""formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Its just an allusion not even a face really.

Also, the aticle says ""there was no alien monument arter all."" if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA

thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it?

In conclusion, the ""face"" was not created by an aliens or aliens, but was just created by a landform.    ",3

032153a,"Put on the brakes!! In this life we must sit back and think about the breath taking beauty of Earth, and I don't know about you but I want to make it last for a long time. So for us to be able to do that we must do what some countrys are already doing..... Limit the amount we drive our cars.

In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vauban's streets are clear of cars, even clear of parking spaces. There are only two places to park, a large grage at the end of the development, where you have to pay $40,000, along with the price of your house. Experts say that this is one of the first real major ways peopl are trying to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions for cars.? In the United States, in car-intensive areas, cars casue up to 50% of all greenhouse emissions.

Also, in Paris they had to ban driving because of the smog. Because of the amounts of pollution there was Paris inforced a partial driving ban in attempt to clear the air of the global city, there was a ?22 fine($31). In Paris, close to 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 cars were impounded for over reacting to the fine. Bogota, Colombia, has ""No car day"", whic millions of Colombians found other ways of transportation such as hiking, walking, riding bikes, or public transpot vechials. The goal of their ""No car day"" is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faces a $25 fine. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. Also, two other colombian cities joined ""No car day"" Cali, and Valledpar. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunci┏n, Paraguay.

The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after, according to research as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was near 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Just shows the we as a group are starting to relize what effect we have on our enviroment.

iDeas such as theses lead me to belive our beauitful Earth will live on if we all agree to drive less and use other ways of transport. its not that much to ask of you, if its a beauitful day out grab your bike not only well it be good for you but also for your enviroment.    ",3
03237a6,"""Resent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". Not having a car is such a great opportunity! It allows you to get a great excercise on your way to work, And everyone is wanting to participate in so many events that lead to Car-free day and many more.

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Columbia. Millions of Civilions were in on this exciting event that started in the 1990's. All Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. The streets of Bogota was a traffic free place for a whole day! ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" Said Antanas Mockus, the mayor of Bogota. People are still riding there bikes and more to work because they feel like everyone should participate and don't think that alittle rain should stop it. But after, for the first time more colombian cities joined in on this day to start a new tradition. According to the Mayor, the day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any latin city. I think more countries should participate in this event, just because you are limiting yourself to how much you use your car and it seems like it would be alot of fun and is honestly such a great opportunity for you and everyone around you trying to make a diffrence.

""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses"". This is actually very surprising knowing that America is and has been one of the world's prime car cultures. ""They are not interested"", Said a mom of two children that are 19 and 21. She said, ""even though they both live in places where one could come in handy....but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take a public transportation or car-pool with friends."" To me I think these adults are making a statment. That you do not always have to have a car, and you most definatly do not have to have a licence to get you places. These teenagers are saving their money not having to worry about gas prices and car payments. Instead they are not wasting their money by walking and car-pooling to their jobs. It might take some time walking but you still get there.

In conclucion, I feel like getting to places with cars is fast, and I know most people agree with me...but why not just once in a couple of days just drop your keys and ride your bike or walk to work. Limit how much you use your car. I promise you you will see a difference in your life.       ??    ",3
03314fd,"After reading this article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I believe that being able to detect and know how to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and could be useful for many. Using technology to know whether an individual is upset, happy, mad, etc. could be used as an improvement on our daily lives. According to the article, they tested this new technology on the famous Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting and defined that ""she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The outcomes from this new technology system could actually be legit and can tell us what people feel. This new sofware can also help the people that are to afriad to express their feelings or don't know how to .

Sense there are some individuals who hid their feelings and aren't that easy to read their emotions by just looking at their facial expressions, by using this system you could read and even track their face movments and even their mixed emotions also. For instance, as stated in the passage ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"".""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This new software can help those who have a ""neutral face"" and show no emotion.

Facial expressions aren't always going to reveal how an individual is actually feeling or what emotions he is going through inside. For example, in the article it indicates that the Mona Lisa is ""9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", even though in the painting she looks 100 percent happy. This software will read off your emotions no matter what face expression you are making. Many of us can use this software to figure out what others are feeling when they are to scared to tell others how they feel. For instance, if someone is feeling really upset and has a neutral face and you can't tell that they are upset, you can't help them unless you know how they are feeling.

In conculsion, I believe that This new software ""Facial Action Coding"" that helps reveal human emotions by using technology cn be valuable and useful for certain people.",3

035e3c7,"Dear state senator,

As a law abiding citizen, I feel that the American public should have a say-so in the elections of the President, or any other government party leader, and to do so, should be a direct vote. While our Founding Fathers, with all due respect, chose the Electoral College to pick and choose our leaders, this is the 21st centuary. A centuary in which the government upholds too much power.

The government has been critized quite intensely over the last few years over one topic - lying. Lying to the citizens in which it - should - be serving. Although, it doesn't. The government serves itself. So why should we elect a panel of people to elect for us? After all, when we vote, we - I speak for the entire American republic here - imagine us submitting our vote to count directly for our selected representative. Not for some unknown nit-wit to chose a government agent for us. What if said nit-wit lies, miscounts, or purposely puts his own imput into the system instead of the American voting population?

Direct voting is, perhaps, inevitably more efficient. Our votes could run through a machine, much like a state test such as FCAT, anf the total vote could be directed for either candidate. The chances of a tied poll is rather extremely unlikely due to the masses of the American republic. Plus, it singles out the chance of lying in a government of liars.

Swing states wouldn't exist. Instead of singling out a particular area of the country, they'd be, more so, targeting the country as a whole, because then would every individual vote mattered. No one would be left out, and the more honest, obviously more chosen, president would win out, and almost everyone would be happy.

We live in a system at which the government lies, quite fairly, a lot. A direct vote would whip them out of that in the voting process, as the votes, singularly, would matter. Every last one of them. It would also nip the idea that only certain areas, certain states, mattered, because again, every vote would matter. Directing voting is obviously the way to go.

Signed,

Law Abiding Citizen.    ",3

On April 5, 1998 Mars Globel Surveyor flow over Cydonia and took a picture and it was a natural landform. The pectures this time were ten times sharper then the ones from the original Viving picture. There was no alien monument after all. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are common to the ones in the American West. They remind us most of the Middle Burre in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In 1945 we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Although there was 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance we crossed the alantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First,We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. Its a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice,and Italy. I got to explore the castel in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There is so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

To being with, limiting the use of cars can be very good for our enviornment because it would make the air less polluted. As stated in source 2 paragraph 5,""congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" thats a big percent and with that we are making the earth green. France even tried to ban cars even and odd to reduce the pollution as being talked about in paragraph 2 and 3. They were being fined if they drove, that is atleast until the air cleared up.

On the other hand, banning cars or not driving is a silly decision. It may be good for our earth and our health, but if you need to leave three hours before hand to reach your destination on time, then you need to buckle up and step on the gas. If gas so so bad for the enviornment, then why dont we ban gas cars? There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficlut for long road trips but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it.

The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.

Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.

It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.

This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars. ",3
037ac1f,"Driverless cars

The point that the article is making is that should we have cars that can drive themselfes, in my opinoin i would say no because it would cause so much disstortion and everthing would be in a heave of trouble. What we would be doing is we would be taking away jobs for people that live off of driving people places, or we would be spending so much money trying to make these cars, and also what would happen when the went out of control and no one could stop them then what would we do.

The idea of people losing jobs dosent sound right for me because i know how frustrating it is to lose many jobs and it isn＞t easy. And something else what would stop those people who are mad and ticked at the idea that they just lost their jobs to a bunch of robots, that wont go so well because they will probably start rioting in the streets and that will just cause more of a problem＞s for everone.

And also you would have to conceder on how much money they would have to spend to keep making those types of cars, it will probably cost millions of dollars for just one state. So they would be spending more money on making the cars than they would be getting so it seems that it would be a waste of time on what this idea has in store.

What other problems would happen if something went wrong with these cars like to say if someone missed up with the programming it could cause a lot of problems across the united states because so many car crashes would be happening, and that would bring so much panic through out the nation. so that is another reason why not to.

So what is the article stating is if we should have cars that control themselfs. there is to many if＞s for me to say that we should like i can see that there are good parts to this like to say that we wouldn＞t spend so much many on gas and it would be safer for the most part. But my answer is still no because we cant alwas y just think that since it is technology we are safe will that not alwas the case and we have to learn that. So no we shouldn＞t have cars that drive themselves.",3
038fd62,"Imagine being able to detect other peoples feelings when they try to hide their emotions. Two doctors think they have the power to do so, Proffesor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsredam and Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

I believe that the new advancment would be a wonderful idea. I believe that seeing somebody's when they are trying to hide them is gonna bring new thrills to life. Actually knowing someone's emotions could be beneficial for thing such as suicide maybe if we knew what somebody's emotions were we would be able to help somebody to make them feel happy. In the passage article for has a quote saying ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I believe this is a good quote because it ties in with me saying that emotions could help people but having facial emotions would benefit as well because then we would not only physically see someone's emotion but we would be able to feel the happiness, pain,anger or etc.

So overall I think Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman could possibly have a amazing overall invention there are lots of positives for this invention. Such as having less suicides, or maybe if seeing someone happy could make someone else happy and could start a emotion train. The passage has some really good put out facts to convince someone that this would be a wonderful idea.",3
03ae0c4,"The Electoral college is something that has been around for hundreds of years, and has helped us decide what to do. It is a fair method of electing the president, but it is not what we need anymore. Times have changed since that was established, so it is time we use a good old-fashioned way of voting, and use election by popular vote.

Back in the seventeenth century, when the Electoral College was created to find a balance between citizen voting and majority vote. How it works, is we select the electors representing our state's votes, they meet and vote, and then congress counts their votes. Also, all states, except Maine and Nebraska have something called the ""winner-take-all"" syatem, and that is a ""system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.""(s1,p7) But now, the citizens in your state who qualify as a voter cast their votes. Instead of that being what our state's choice is, we choose the electors of our candidate, or person we voted for, and then the candidate with the majority votes wins, getting atleast 270 out of 538 electoral votes. This seems very unfair, and in one specific case, it is. In the 2000 presidential election, between Al Gore and George Bush, Al Gore got more popular votes than George Bush; he should have won. But Bush had more electoral votes, and that was where is mattered. So, Bush won that. If Gore won popularity wise, he should have won, hense creating happier citizens, since he won the majority of their votes.

Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, ""may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" This is very important, as we all want a good leader who will support our home state. If, for example, the Electoral College voted on a Democrat, and he won, Florida may not have much hope. Florida is a Republic state, as is most of the southern states; yes, Mr. President would be obligated to help all 50 states when necessary, but the bigger benefits would go towards the Democratic states, and probably his home state. Therefore, voters may not even bother casting in a ballot if the candidate of their choice does not have much hope, or if they think either potential leader will benefit them. So if they do not have much of a choice in the matter, they lose interest and shrug it off, as opposed to if it were popular vote, and every single vote was accounted for. Fortunately, though, this does not happen often; one meesly vote does not do much to turn the tables.

The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation.    ",3

Almost 44 nations come together to make that ONE nation.

This program is

life time decision you can't miss it for anything. If you like animals well you need to come on this trip we have animals on board with us to take them oversea, We have many unique animals on with us

the passage states that they are horses; young cows; mules; pigs, However we just don't leave them in the boat with no feed or water or shelter we help those animals we feed them everyday, We keep them clean and there living areas clean so they wont get ill or get any kind of disease to spend to the another animals.

So I want you to join our program why wouldn't you join so we can save those animals from

getting any diseases or dieing from hungrier, or thirst. We just not there for the animlas for the countries too, We go to many fun and exciting countries. Have you ever wanted to go to a countries so bad? Well we can take you there, too sight the Magnificent things in life. ",3

Maybe us as a society has the wrong idea of cars and what they do for us. Cars have been givin this impression that they are what us young adults want and need to become an adult or even for some people ''cool'' but we've got the wrong idea.

Americans use cars almost everyday, numerous times a day, spening loads of money on gas and filling up our ozone with pollution but for most lifes outisde the United States they prefer to walk, bike ride, run anything except a car. Vaubran ,Germany have given up their cars. 70% of Vaubrans families do not own cars and about 57% sold a car to move there. Giving that most subrub lifes are over populated there would be no room for all those cars, but if you're that person that needs a car you must buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. ''When I had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way'' said by Heridrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, as she walks the busy path ways of Vauban streets. MOst countries are like Vauban, over populated with little to no car usage. Most people travel by foot, bus or bike and have been proven to not only heelp save thier environment but save lifes but you still have some countries that work like America. Bogota, Colombia does us cars very frequent but has a ''car free'' day which a large amount of Colombias population (7 million) participates in. '' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode with his wife on a two seat bicycle as it poured. '' The rain didnt stop people from participating'', ''We enjoy this, its better for us as a society''. Many other countries saw this remarkable change that they were trying to accomplish and really were motivated to cut cars out and start walking, biking..

Paris, France typically has more smog than other European capitals. The cause for this smog is to be said it comes from the Diesel fuel since Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles droven in France. The smog was so serious and dangerous that it traveled to Beijing China, which they did not need since they are the most populate city in the world.? France and lots of other countries have smog/ pollution problems caused by cars. France has plug-in cars, hybrids, more cars carrying three or more passangers, and public transport free of charge Friday threw Monday clogging up our o-zone. Many people across the globe have notice this big error its causing and try to make a stop to it. Lots of citizens try to cut back on their driving or try to find closer areas to work or for school to make it easier them to walk, bike ride to. For instance, the sons of Michael Sivak who are in their 20's travel by foot since driving was ''not a big concern for them.'' ''They organize their summer jobs and social lifes around where they can walk, take public transport or car pool with friends''. Even young adults are seeing the greatness in doing something good for them and thier environment.

Driving is a big part of our world today, but we have some people and even countries who have to or choose to do it by foot. Its proven to help the mind? and also proven to help with our environment and our safety life. Pollution fills the air but so does the people, making the world a better place to live and causing less stress to the citizens that do so.       ?    ",3

The awareness stays with them. Here's why you should join.

First off, the adventure! You will sail across the world and visit many wonderful countries and their people in your quest to provide relief from a terrible disaster. It sounds like something right out of a storybook, doesn't it? Another reason is the sightseeing. You are provided with lots of freetime, so why not enjoy the beauty of both Mother Nature and mankind whilst you're on your journey. Maybe you'll get lucky and get to see the Panama Canal, or the temples of China. Also, wouldn't it be great to see the happy people and, most importantly, the children who you're going to help get back on their feet.

03f2d76,"Computers can read your mind?! No, not really, but they can tell how you're feeling. A new technolagy created by Dr. Thomas Huang, allows computes to read your facial expresions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how this new technology can be valuable. This technology that we can use to read students emotinal expressions would be valuable.

Because of the students facial expression, the computer can tell if the student is confused from a lesson in class. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"". If the computer could understand when the student is having a problem and can effectively fix that issue, then this could be the best way to teach. The use of reading students emotional expressions is valuable, because they can be taught better.

eventhough it may not seem praticle to use this technology, students can actualy learn from it. ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D comuter model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles... Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS(Facial Action Coding Sytsem) has classified six basic emotions -happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". Eckman's technology has a lot of information studets can learn. The technology is valuable because the students that use it can learn and better understand diffrent facial expresions made by others.

The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable. it can teach students about other facial expressions, or whatever they are learning in class. With the help of this new technology we can ensure students to have better grades go to better schools, and in the end make the world a much smarter and better place.",3

By wanting to live in a more healty place we need to keep the air clean, that is one of are biggest problems with useing cars all the time. One way there are trying to accomplush this is by makeing homes an cities denser, so that its would be better for walikng or biking riding. making these homes more compact there would be molre accesibletily to public transportation. which would leave more space for better walk was . By doing this we are reducing car use an saveing the air a little at a time ,to imp[rove this world.

03f958f,"""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" Cars that can drive independently are a huge advancement in technology, travel, saftey, and history. Driverless cars, which they are called, are a positive and wonderful thing to have. This essay will provide why driverless cars should be developed.

Although there has been a large leap in vehicle technology, the cars are not yet completely driverless. With more and more research and test being done there will one day be a completely driverless car.

When the vechicle was first invented it took many trial and errors but it was never given up on. The driverless car is in the stage of developement and should not be given up on. People do not forget the first model vechicle because it changed history and made things easier and more convient. The same thing can happen with the driverless car.

""Their (Google) cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.""

Crashes can be caused by anything, but having vehicles that drive the exact same could potentially reduce the risk of accidents. In the driverless cars, drivers are still needed to stay alert at the wheel because the car cannot handle obstacles such as: passing constrcution or passing accidents. They need to continue to test and develope the driverless car so one day it can over come these obstacles.

With all cars there are dangers. If the driver of the driverless car is to cause an accident then the driver is held responsible. This car cannot promise hundred percent safety, and neither can any other vehicle. That does not let automakers stop them from continuing their work. The more reseach and developement they do the more problems they can resolve. Car manufactures have plans to make cars compelety capable of driving themselves.

The driverless car may take a few years to be made perfect, but automakers are not willing to give up. A driverless car can be good for technology advances, safety, travel, and a mark in history. Driverless cars need to be backed and have support in order to be completely succsessful. And the more developement and reseach done the closer automakers become to creating a change in history, a driverless car.",3
03ff4c1,"First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.

Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.

Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.

Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?

In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.

04030c7,"Although it does seem like looking back to the past is the right thing, sometimes changing the past can have good effects for the future. The founding fathers that established the United States Constitution also established the Electoral College. Even though it has been used for many years it is the not most accurate form of voting. The popular vote is much more accurate in which the citizens of the United States vote for who they want.

One of the many problems with the Electoral College system is that the citizens of that state don't vote for president. Instead they vote for electors which then vote for president. They vote for the electors that they think are trustworthy and are going to vote for the candadite they want to win. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors an end of voting for the wrong candidate. In addition there can be a tie in the Electoral College and in that case the election would be thown to the House of Reprsentatives where state delegations vote on the president.

Every state receives an amount of point decided by the population of that state. ""It is unfair for voters because of the winner takes all system."" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) If a state is won by only 3 votes the candidate that wins the state, takes all the points for that state. Therefore it is possible to win the Popular vote and lose the Electoral Vote. In that case the winner of the electoral vote would be pronounced president of the United States of America.

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Each state has a favorable amount of democrats or republicans, therefore, candidates don't go to states or run ads in states they know the cannot win due to the state being to far into the enemy party. States that change from a democrat to a republican state and vice versa are called ""swing"" states. Those are states that the candidates running for president will want to visit and run ads in.

Electoral College has followed us since the Constitution was established, but it is time that we leave it behind and look to a new voting system. We need to abolish Electoral College because it is an unreliable way for to run the campaign for becoming the president of the United States of America.    ",3
04128c7,"Driving cars that could drive you anywhere as in a taxi or your own car are finally coming to our furture and comig fast. There are many people out there who disagree on the idea Google has came out with. There are many different reson why you should and should buy this car they can be seen in positives and negatives. My reason when it comes to buying a driveless car is that you should or try to get a driveless car, but on the other had there are some bad reason why you shouldnt.

First few positive reasons I think you should buy this car is because its a proven fact that it can lower the risk of texting a driving. Since the 2000s the rate of texting and rving drivng has went up a massive of numbers. And plus they made a few models of the google car back in 2000 for a special track and it proved that its safe and could lower the stakes of a accident. They took one to the street and drove it 1 million miles and havent even crashed yet. But when it comes to parking and coming in a drive way its up to the driver to do that.

Then when it comes down to the gas its very conservant. For an example when the driver is sleepy or had a long day at work they can take a little nap whe its in driveless mode. If there are any roadblocks or construction problems the car will alert the driver that it is time to take action and drive. And if there is any misconveince the car will knock down the speed to about 25 mph. This furture car can turn, accelerate and even brake. Is this what we been waiting for all of our lifes?

Finaly when it comes down to buying this car do it!! Who would ever imagine a car driving itself when ever the driver needs it to. Like a friendly robot that is always there for you when you need them. In this few positives and barely any negatives my addvice is add the new car to your collection or garage. ",3
0425a6e,"In this article the author is talking about going to Venus. The author explains the reasons why we should explore this planet. The author mentions that they should study Venus despite the danger it presents. Venus is the closest planet from the Earth in terms of density, size, and occasionally in distance too. Is Venus so inhospitable, why do scientist want to learn more of this planet? Venus has been proven a very challenging place to examine more closely.Why is it so important to visit Venus? What are the risks of going to Venus? What would the conditions be to go to Venus?

Venus is the second planet from our sun. Not even a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. Each previous mission was unmanned, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Studyng Venus is a challenge to humans. Venus atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Of any planet from our solar system Venus has the hotterst surface. Astronomers believe that Venus once was like Earth. In tis article it it mentioned that long ago Venus used to be covered lagerly by oceans and problaby had many forms of life. Venus still have certain characteristics that relate to the Earth like valleys, mountains, craters, and rocky sediments. Returning to Venus is indisputable, scientists and astronomers are trying to figure out the ways to make this mission safe and scientifically productive? The NASA has an idea to sending humans to study Venus. This idea would allow them to float above the fray, temperatures would still be at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However researchers cannot take samples of any kind from a distance. Nasa researchers are working on safer ways to study Venus. Reseachers are thinking in using old technology called mechanical computers. But why not use modern computers and more advanced technology?

Well modern technology is tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. This challenge is to human curiosity which will lead to equally intimidating endeavors.

In conclusion in order to visit Venus there are many dangers that could occur. But how the author suggested despite the dangers. In the article mentions many danger of visiting Venus and the ways reseachers are trying to find to visit Venus safe and to learn. Studying Venus would help humanity to discover new things.

There will be dangers in this challenge but it's worth it. The author explains why they should study Venus and give details and explains the dangers of this challenge.",3

Some of his arugements for driveless are very interesting and definitly out weighs the cons of driveless cars. Threes three main points that he made for driveless cars and how fast we're coming closer to having them everywhere. With driveless cars you can have you car drive up to 25mph, brake when you're to close to another car, and they can also notify the driver if he or she isn't paying attention to the road. Everyday we're getting close and closer to having complete driveless cars!

In 2013 BMW made a car that can handle speeds up to 25mph and they also added a really inavaiting feature in it; The car has special touch sensors that alert you anytime you take your had off the wheel. There's so many benfits to this. Let say someone is speeding four times over the speed limit and you have to move out the way before they can hit you, with your hands being on the wheel and the car driving you can move out the way and take complete control of the car. Another example is if you were driving your son/daughter to their friend's house and you had to look for which house you can sit the car to do the driving while you're looking for the house and that alone can help a may reduces finder benders in neighbrohoods because the car can break when its getting close to another car all on its own.

Noitifcations. Some car companies have been trying to make cars that have a hands up flashing light on the windsheld when you take your hands off the when or aren't paying attention to the road. This idea can help pervent so many accendents and help improve drving skills.

In conclusion all these ideas and all this new terchonology in cars will help stop and lower the percentage of accidents dramaticlly. Anywhere from having the car break on its own to drving a certain speed limit while you look for your childs friend's house can help stop so many accidents. We are getting closer and closer to a safer drving age each and everyday.        ",3
0435f85,"The author didnt support this claim very well. The author talked alot about the dangers in Venus rather the good that comes from Venus. I say this because as I am reading I see how the author mentions many of times how Venus has extreme tempetures and how no one has went to Venus because of these extreme conditions.

The author says in paragraph 2 ,""Numerous factors contribute to Venus?s reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" Which gives the idea that it is a very dangerous place. You may begin to question ""Why would any one want to go to Venus"" or you may say to yourself ""This is not any where that i would want to go."" The author also states in paragraph 3,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus?s atmosphere."" This is even more if a danger sign. No one would want to be anywhere where you could potentially suffocate. We also know from this paragraph that Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The author states in paragraph 6 ,""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The author gives us tons and tons of reasons why it is not worth going to Venus.

From what I have read today I will never want to go to Venus. The author gave plenty of good reasons on why we should not go to Venus. It is not a place for humas as we have already read. So i feel as if the author did not do a good job supporting his claim on why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.",3
043d7ad,"I bielive that this computer system is vauleable because this can tell emotions, it may also help you communicate,and help teachers with students.

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

043e1a0,"May 24, 2001 was the date it all started. When the ""Face on Mars"" conspiracy began. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling a region of Mars called Cydonia. The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

After a few days of the finding of the ""Face"" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see. They added a capition to the image that quoted ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors used the photo as a propaganda to get the publics attention to Mars, and it rsulted on good high notes. The ""Face of Mars"" became an pop icon from starring in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkut lines for 25years! Then to clear up that the ""Face"" didn't show signs of life Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped the same image ten times sharper and it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien momument after all. They tried another picture after people wouldn't believe the landform idea and the Martian came equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin said it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In conclusion the image of the ""Face On Mars"" sparked contrivsory in if it was a face or a natural landfrom. You had all the public believing it was a face and NASA saying it was a landform. This challenged NASA to prove that the face was indeed a landfrom. They got sharper images in where it clearly shows a butte/mesa. Although the public didn't believe in NASA it sure did make NASA have a reason for its reaseach. The shared their discoveries with everyone and the public responded. Which I say it was what NASA wanted all along.",3
044a23f,"Have you ever heard of the process of electoral college? As stated in paragraph two of the article? source one ''does the electoral college work?'' by the office of the federal register it is a process in which the selection of the electors,the meeting of the electors where they vote for the new upcoming president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. Many citizens or congress men are for and against the electoral college process. I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because they are chose, not just how much the voters like them but their cababilities so more modern. Also more reliable.

To begin with, I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because it is more reliable than election by popular vote. When you vote for the presidential election you help select your state's electors when you vote for president of your choice because when you vote for your candidate your actually voting for your candidates electors. As stated in paragraph six in source one. Also these electors aren't just every day people they are carryfully selected to take place in these events. For example, you walk into your local precint to vote on the fourth year on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You enter your voting booth and vote for the president of your choice, so you think. You are actually voting for your states electors. so thats one of the reasons why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, I am in favor of keeping the electoral college because it is more modern,accurate and reliable. Most people vote for the president of there choice becuase of what they say theyll while in presidency, or how good they look, rescent experince, and how much they like that perticular president. Do you really want some one who knows nothing about the president of thier choice but how good they look,to vote for the the next leader of our country. As stated in paragraph eight in source one it states that the electors represnt our vote and choosse president accordingley. For example, a women walks into her local pricent and decides to vote for the president that looks better that isnt an ancurate vote cause she just voted for the president she likes and what if want to run this country into the ground. so thats why I am in favor of keeping the electoral college.

To conclude, because the electoral college is more reliable and more accuerate is why i am in favor of keeping the electoral college. So on that fourth year on the tuesday after the first monday of november you go into to make your vote make a wise choice and remeber your voting for your state's electors.       ?    ",3
045fec2,"Would driverless cars really be helpful to people if they were successfully made? They would probably turn out to be something great if manufacturers succeeded in making these cars. Cars like these sound just as good as flying cars in the future. However, driverless cars do not seem to be a good thing for society. There could be a few problems if this type of car was created and here are some of those problems.

Driverless cars are not good for the society if they are made. Firstly, people would be more lazy than they already are if introduced to this. We already have sensors to help us with driving, so what more do we need. People are already lazy enough today because of technology. This idea would not help society at all if it were introduced to us.

Secondly, in paragraph nine, they state that if one were to be in a car accident, on one will really know who is at fault. In addition to that, people could lie, saying that it was the car's fault, thus people would blame the manufacturers. There could be a lot companies sued because of car accidents and of people who do not want to tell the truth. Also, what happens when a driverless car hits a pedestrian? Driverless could do a lot of bad things and it would all fall on top of the company.

Lastly, there is truly no point in making driverless cars because the driver is not doing a lot in the first place. People know how to drive already and there is no point in making a car that does everything that the driver can already do. This goes back to the laziness part. People also know that there's no point, but yet they decide we should have it because of their laziness. These are some reasons on why driverless cars are not good for society.

Driverless are not a good idea and should not be introduced to society. Honestly, it would step up our game with technology, but we should not waste with something like a driverless car. We can do so much more with this kind technology and should not take it for granted. We should be using our brains for thinking of a way to stop global warming or even the flying car idea sounds nice. To cnoclude, creating driverless cars is not a good idea.   ",3
046e84a,"Unmasking the Face on Mars

The ""face"" on mars has been a very common or popular story, when 25 years ago viking 1 spacecraft snapped a photo of what looked like a two mile long ""face"" that seemed to be staring back at the camera. Many were suprised and shocked at the sight and many conspiracy theorist belived it was a alien artifact but scientist found and believed it was an martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. It takes the shape of a face but also unusual shadows made it out to look like an egyptian pharoh when mesa's were more commonly found proving the ""face"" theory uncredible.

At NASA we feel like the ""face"" found on mars is just a natural land mark or a mesa. At NASA we think it is a lava that takes form as an isolated mesa. Although it looks like a face and some theories say it is bona fide evidence of life on mars, we have factual evidence to believe it is a mesa like in the snake river plain in Idaho and also commonly found on Cydonia around where the ""face"" was.

Yes, the landmark resebles a face and shadows make out a eyes, nose and mouth shape to also contribute to the illusion that it could be thought of as proof of aliens or alien civilizations on mars but, there is really no for sure credible evidence that could explain and prove it is an 100% acual bona fide face. It is more likely and more proven to be a simple mesa such as some of the mesa landmarks on earth. Along with the people who feel it is an alien artifact some scientist also believed it was indeed an alien artifact also but sadly it is not altough at NASA we wish we could uncover an Alien civilization on Mars.

In conclusion, this ""face"" is nothing more than a Martian equivilent of a mesa or butte. Although the popular suspition and popularity of it being a ""face on Mars"" it is nothing more than a landform that is also common around the American West. Not only that but, Skeptics and authors felt it would be a good way to attract attention to Mars which could lead to the truth being streched without physicl evidence to back up their theories.",3
046efe7,"I belive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not possible for people to live on Mars, there are no such thing as aliens, and why would there just be a head shape object and not the rest of the body. In the passage it says, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Also how could there be life on Mars. Mars has no oxygen so people can breathe. All NASA wanted to do was ,"" engage public and attract attention to Mars."" also in the text it states that NASA said,"" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shodows giving the illusionb of eues, nose and mouth.""

The Face on Mars is not real because it is just a natural landform caused by erosion and broken rocks. An example from the text is, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.""

Secondly another reason the Face is a nautural landfrom is because it is not possible for people to live on Mars. Studies have shown that there is no oxygen on Mars and people can not breathe there. Also the preasure of the gravity on Mars would be too much for a human and could crush their bones and musles. Thirdly, why would the rest of the body not be with the Face. That proves that the Face is just a natural landfrom create by erosion and rocks because if the Face was there on the ground why wouldnt the rest of the body by with the Face.

In conclusion the face is just a natural landfrom becuase NASA have send rovers up to Mars to take pictures of the Face and NASA said themselves,""when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. So that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Also in the text it states,"" New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.""        ",3
047a377,"The use of technology suchas, Facial Action Coding system, is totally uneccessary in the classroom setting. Claiming that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' "" is an ineffective way to to really, truly get through to the students. Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. In the article, it says "" we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day"". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is uneccessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. In the article is says "" ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucor' ""

The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with. All in all, adding more uneccessary technology into the classroom would be distracting to the students and an invaison of their privacy. The ""Facial Action Coding system"" could be useful somewhere else, just not the classroom.",3
047f2c6,"I don't think that the idea of a driverless car is a good idea. I feel as if driverless cars are just the fact of people being lazy. I don't understand what's hard about driving a car just for a short amount of time. Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down.

On the positive side these driverless car might be a good idea for someone that's always is on the go & they get tired of driving. It may also be good for the mothers of young children. Only when the child is crying the can have the car driving it's self while they get the baby in order. They should really make that a feature of the car. Other than that the car seems worthless & is just another car problem that us Americans would have.

Then we have the negative & I could go on & on about this one. Now having a driverless is just insane & lazy. First off what is the point of having a car if it's just going to drive it's self? I think it would cause more accident & like the article said; who's fault would it be the would the accident be on? Then insurance would be at an all time high, because the makers of these cars are going to find everyway to make these more advanced then the next, like I said in the first paragraph how much EXACTLY would it cost to buy A car like this or even fix a car like this ? Literally us as people only make enough to support our families & pay the bill. Having to buy these cars would be another thing to break us.

To wrap things up, in my opinion i think this car is something that they should second guess. It might benefit some people & others it might put a steep hole in their pocket. Once again i feel as if there is no purpose of having a car if you're not going to drive it.",3
0499982,"My position on driverless cars is that I am a against the development of these cars. My three reasons why I don't agree with this is because they don't do all the driving, not all drivers will be paying attiontion, and people won't need to get a lissions or need there permit and it will break the cartural of driving.

The car dosn't drive all by itself you will to take over if there is work zones or if there is accidents. Since it dosn't drive on work zones or by acciedents how would you knowif there is one? What if you sleeping? If your going on a high way and your sleeping on a long road trip and there is an accendent ahead of you or there is work zones you wouldn't possable know and you will be ending up in a accedent.

This leads to my second reason that not all drivers will be paying attintion on the road since the car will be driving by it self they won't no need to be looking at the road. They will be busy on there phone or be sleeping. This will cause alot of increase of accidents if diviers don't payattintion while the car is driving. Also it will increase alot of accidents in teens since they will be on there phone and wouln't care whats going on.

My last reson is that people won't need a permit or a lissions anymore.This could be dangrous. Since the car is going to be doing all the work there isn't a point of passing the permit test if your not taking the wheel, or the lisson test of driving the car because your not going to be driving its the car. This will affect us because we never know the people out there and can't trust them all.

This is why I dissagree in the driverless cars. This will affect us and cause more accidents and people won't be paying atintion.This is why I dont think agree with this.   ",3

04a99cb,"""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""

Dear Senator I strongly suggest you on changing to election by popular vote and getting rid of the Electoral College. As you can see on the quote above people really don't like the Electoral College. This would be a very wise decision because the Electoral College is very old and unfair and it cause many crisis to happened.

First and foremost the Electoral College is very old.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is getting old and unfair so we should start fresh with a new change from electoral college to popular vote. Also the electoral college sometimes causes many crisis.

It states in the article "" The single best argument against the electoral college is that we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows for much worse.""

This quote explains how the electoral college caused a fiasco in 2000 because of the electoral college and if we don't get rid of it we could have another one of these crisis.

On the other hand the electoral college should not be taken away because our founding fathers established it.

It states in the article ""Source 1: What is the Electoral College?"" ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

This quote illustrates how the electoral college is suppose to help us and noy hurt us. Also our founding fathers established so they were just trying to get everything in order and have peace with everyone.

Although the electoral college is very unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

It states in the article ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why the best-laid of defense of the system are wrong"" ""At the most basic level, the electoral coolege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on only the tight race in the ""swing"" states.""

This quote explains how the electoral college is unfair and doesn't give chances to other states that supposively have no chance on voting for that certain canditate.

All in all Senator the electoral college must be abolish. Not only does it create many disasters, but it is very unfair to us citizens. The electoral college is very old and we should give a break. We could start with something fresh like the popular vote and see how it turns out. As you can see there is many evidence on how the electoral college is bad and that you should give the popular vote a chance.    ",3
04b4ad6,"""Out travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers or doubt"" The author of this article belives that it's worthy to study Venus no matter the dangers we could be face to face with.

In the article the author states we should travel beyond despite all the dangers we could come across. This author supports his idea by stateing that we could go beyond our imagination and innovation. NASA is working on sending humans to go and study up closely Venus. I think we should study different planets only if we are not faced with any danger in our way, this way we know if most of the planets are survivable.

In the article the author states if and when we arrive to Venus it could be tough desicion and with unease conditions but it could be survivable for humans. Radiation would be one of the dangers we would have to face. Another aspect that would make the conditions on Venus uneasy would be the fact that air pressure could get us really ill if and when we travel there.

In my opinion i think the opportunitiy of traveling to any other planet such as our neighbors Mars and Venus are a great way to go above and beyond out of our planet. This would be such a great opportunity

for us to travel to different planets, then again if we dont come acroos any dangers.

This would be a great exploration for us to send humans to study other planets as the author states and when we do, we will know what we are up againist.      ",3
04c4f26,"Dear,state senator

The Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you.

The first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors.

This being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust. When they take these chances they are setting themselves up for disaster.

I hope that you take what I said into consideration. These are just a few of the things that are wrong with the Electoral College system. Its only a matter of time before people like me start to realize everything wrong with the system we have now, and when they do realize the things wrong with it, they will want something done about it. Please help get a better system going and end this Electoral College crap we have now.       ?    ",3
04cecb6,"Are driverless cars really coming? I don't think so. Driverless cars stiil need a driver, they might not even start, or work properly, and the driverless cars will surely bring the number of deaths due to a car accident up. Who wants one now? I don't want to be around one nor do I want anyone to drive these ""driverless"" cars.

The driverless cars, aren't even close to driving themselves, they still need to have the driver's attention. Driverless cars, should be as the title states, cars that are driverless. These cars, will give you warnings when it is going to need you to take control again. The author states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when theroad ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" If these cars were really driverless, they wouldn't need a driver to help them navigate. Are these cars really driverless? No.

Are these cars going to run on gas or electricity? Either way, these cars not start. A car stalls all the time, but those cars we handle, but what about cars that are driverless? Would we know how to fix it or would we have to spend hundreds to get it fixed? These cars will cost hundreds to get fixed over and over again. Who wants to do that? I wouldn't mind having to charge it but then my electricity bill will be over the top expensive.

Would our kids be safe to be in the cars? What happens if our kids are playing and the car starts and the kid gets hurt or even dies? Would it be your fault or the car producers? It woul be everyone's. Ours, for not protecting our kids well enough and the car producers because they didn't think of the children. The number of deaths per year of children due to car accidents are already high, add in a car that might start by itself and run by itself, will increase the number greatly. I wouldn't want my kids near it. Neither should you.

Knowing these facts, do you still want one? Do you want a car that was supposed to be driverless, but you would still need to drive it, or a car that might not even work, or even a car that could possibly kill your kid? I don't. These cars are dangerous, no matter how safe they say it should be. My position on the driverless cars will always be no. ",3
04d13e6,"Having a driverless car may be the gretest or the worst thing someone could have. I am not against on driverless cars because they can be safe, prevent texting and driving accidents, and they alert you when you need to take control of the car. Not only because they drive themselves mean that they are amazing, it can just help to prevent accidents more often.

Driverless cars may be safer than an actual person driving. A mother may have to give the bottle to the baby because it won't stop crying and the car can take care of driving while the mother feeds the baby. Maybe they are listening to music and are more into the music than into the driving. A driverless car can take care of pressing the brake at the right time to stop before something happens. Also that person may not be in good conditions to drive the car and need to get to a doctor or something. That would be if there isn't something else out there that will have to make you take control of the car.

These driverless cars alert you when you need to take the wheel and control it yourself. It is a good thing becuase they probably know that they can't drive through what is happening. Like said in the passage, their can be a traffic jam or there can be an accident and that would be a reason why the car will alert you. It would be a bad thing that the car wouldn't tell you when to take over because it would just stop working all of the sudden and that would't be good. But what would be good is to prevent you from having a accident while texting.

Many teens and even adults now text while driving. They feel like if they don't respond at that instant moment the world is going to end or something. A driverless car can prevent that becuase it can be driving itself and you could answer a call or a text and then get back to driving. The car can prevent you from having an accident from not paying attention to the road. Also maybe you can't find your phone and it keeps on rinigng and it distracts you so the car can take care of the driving while you search for the phone.

In conclusion having a driverless car can be a great thing because you can respond an emergency text without having a fear of dying, it can be safe for you and passengers, and it alerts you when you need to take control. It can be a good thing for the future because more and more technology comes out each year and we are always amazed by everything we see.  ",3
04da4bf,"Have you heard about FACS? Its full name is glory is ""the Facial Action Coding System"".It basically allows to tell which emotion the persons feeling. It seems like a great and wonderful device to have in work places and school places! I think we/they should have these devices in places that best need them! Like in and out the classroom.

I think its valuable because when your in a classroom teachers tend to ususally do a lesson even though all the students get bored out of their minds and end up not paying atention!! Same goes for doing a lesson on this computer, the classroom would be able to recognize the students emotions if the school had some of thses devices, but right now we don't because not all schools cant afford new high tech computers to recognize the childrens emotions! In the text it states

""A classroom computer could recognize when a studenr. Hat is becoming cinfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure! With this it would probably take a while but easy t the same time, because there are so much combinations to this peice of technology! In the text it staes ""he facial expressions for each emotion are univeral,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Like not smiling as broadly). This tells that there are so many emotions to decode! Now how this works is the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and detects all your muscles in your face to determine what emotion your in. In the text so far states that Eckman has classifed 6 basic emotions and they are; happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, this mechine would be most useful in classrooms because teachers and computer programs can change up so that the students would not be so bored and not pay attention! So they correct their lessons and can make it entertaining and fun for everyone!",3

It might be a risky and dangerous job but, this might also be a golden opportunity to, maybe find out connections between Venus and our Earth.

Astonomers believe that Venus used to be an Earth-like planet long ago. There are actual some features now on Venus that resmbles to Earth wiith familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and even craters. Furthermore, let us not forget the fact that Venus also sometimes is our nearest option for a plantery visit. That should be more than enough reason to try and study more of Venus. One day we might need that information, so better safe then sorry.

Lastly, even though is will be difficult scientist are already figuring out safer options to study Venus, like hovering over the planet to gather intel without a real big risk. And even getting electronics tested for Venus's harsh climate. It might be difficult but, where would we be if we just gave up trying to discover new things when things get tough.

04e1cec,"Have you ever been really bored of something, but your teacher in class can't tell? The Facial Action Coding system can be enabled on computers that can identify human emotions. There have been many scientists and researchers that are working on this so it can detect your emotions by the muscles in your body. It is kind of like when you are trying to detect a friends emotion because you can tell how they are feeling.

Imagine this a system that can read your emotions based on your facial expressions that is based off of facial muscles. This is something we already kind of do when we try to tell a friends facial expressions. This is something that we humans should be happy to have we hate being bored and a computer would be able to tell that we are, so it would never play that video or ad again which would make it would modify the lesson for each person according to Huang. Also if you really liked that video or ad that was just played they would play simliar ones to it.

Dr. Huang also explains that most communication is non verbal in fact most of our communication is non verbal.

So, what is the Facial Action Coding System you might be thinking. Well the facial action coding system is a computer that constructs a 3d model of each persons face. This must take a while since we do have 44 major muscles in our face. This computer is basically supposed to be able to detect at least the 6 main basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The machine can do so by it can tell the characteristic movements of each facial muscle. The article describes like when you raise your eyebrows you show surpise and when the muscles around your lips it shows anger. This can be benificial in a lot of ways especially when it can tell that you don't like something. Also humans might try to guess facial traits, but we can't describe each facial trait someone has.

Surely you are thinking that a machine can't detect somebodies emotions, but it could detect that the Mona Lisa she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful, and

2% angry. The machine might have some faults at first, but surely if they can make something like that they could improve it. This could be what humans need something or somebody that actually knows how we feel. If that's not convincing if we have psychologists that can detect our emotions based on our smile why can't they help the people coding these machines and get everything right.

In conclusion, is there a machine that can detect our feeling. There could be something or someone that can help in the near future, but currently this is just a project. This is something that could be in the future that will replace our current computers and/ or our smartphones. This is a start to something that could reveal al lot about us, our faces, and our emotions. ",3

To begin with, most presidnets elected most of the time make no difference and citizens are not content. Presidents have many duties to complete and of them is to make changes and make the world a better place for all citizens. in the article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner he states ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" what the author clearly states is that society is not voting for a presidential candidate but for a slate of electors. This is why most of the time society is not content with the president chosen and bad changes are made. Citizens are the ones who live in this country so they should be the one's who's votes are counted for electing presidents so that they do not suffer the next four years.

To continue, some presidential candidates intentions to society are harmful and do not help them in anyway possible. Presidents intentions while on their four years of being presidents are supposed to help society and make their life easier and not worse. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer he states ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Somtimes."" this quote shows that not only is society not voting for the presidential candidate they are in favor of but they cant even control who their electors vote for sometimes. Citizens in anyway possible can not vote for the presidential candidate they are in favor of so that means society will not be content for four years and changes will be made that will make their lifes harder and some priveliges will be taken away if the presidents intentions are not helpful. Society will be living in hell in other words.

04ec9a4,"Have you ever thought about participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program? It's every fun, it allowed me to go on adventures and vist unique places like Greece, Venice, Italy, and I even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are also others things to do besides go to different places when you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Even though you get free time there is also work to do. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I just couldn't say no, I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime. Let me give you some reason on why you should join.

Like i said before there are others things you have to do when participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One thing is you have to take care animals. Everytime I found it fun taking care of the animals, especially on when I returned from trips and the animals had been unloaded. There were different types of animals on board like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. Once there was even a cargo with 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

My next reason is you also get to play games on the ship. The cowboys and I played baseball, volleyball games, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games helped us pass time when we didnt have work to do. Sometimes we would even play games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would even have different types of tournaments.

The most important and my last reason is that while in the Seagoing Cowboys we had to help different people with things. We had to help them with animals, food, and we had to help on the ship. There were many things we had to do on the ship like be watchmen, check the animals every hour, and make an hourly report to the captain. There is a lot of work you have to put in into being a Seagoing Cowboys even if you do get hurt. But it will be all worth it in the end.

I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It was very fun for me, so if i had fun being one then I feel like you will to. You will have a lot of fun trust me. ",3
04ef8ff,"After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it made me inclined to think that a driverless car would be a benefical thing to have. They could potentally reduce driver made accidents and make the roads run safer and smoother than they do today.

Some people may believe that driverless cars are dangerous, but they may not realize that safety is one of the major concerns that manufacturers have. They still plan on having the driver maintain alert and ready to take control of the car if needed. In paragraph 7, the writing states that, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This leads me to believe that these cars are safe.

There are still some issues involving the driverless cars. Such as figuring out who is at fault if there is an accident. Would the driver in the car or would the manufacturer of the car be held responsible? These are good questions, but the writing says that, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Which means that chances are the laws will change and the people will decide what the future laws of the driverless cars will be.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless cars are going to be made no matter what. The car manufacturers are continuing to make imporvements to the cars sensors and computers everyday. The article even says that, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" So, driverless cars are going to happen, and they are going to happen soon.",3
0502b23,"Technology in the classroom has always been a great idea, it allows for students to find information quicker, keep all their assignments in one place. But now it could be used to interpret the emotions of students. This technology could be used to detect how students are feeling about a teachers teaching style; this software could also detect if a student is bored or confused, and even if they are sad or angry.

Using this technology can help determine what is neccesary in keeping a classroom engaged and happy. But students may not want a machine reading their emotions at all times in a classroom, say that a student has lost a loved one and doesn't want that to be public to the faculty at the school because he might be treated diffrent. The technology could detect his sadness and the teacher may try to comfort him, or tell other teachers about the way he feels. But for the greater good of possibly detecting depressed or suicidal students may out weigh the bad that the technology may produce. I am for this type of technology in the classroom, its benifits out weigh its fallbacks, other than possibly being inaccurate due to displaying false emotions.

The use of emotional recognition software in the classroom is a great idea to keep students in the minds of their teachers and truely help them create an environment that is catered to the happiness of their students. Lets not forget how useful it will be to detect if students are actually learning in the classroom. And probaly most importantly to detect students who may be a threat to themselves or others.",3
051429c,"In the Article ""The challengle of Exploring Venus""

the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" (para 3.)

The article states, "" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" (para 2) I think the author means by that is humans can not really study Venus's because its in space and no human can go up there too long and study it since its the secong planet next to the sun.

The planet is dangerous because its right by the sun which if you go by the sun you can burn and die from it. The planet's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

It also has 97 percent carbon dioxide which means the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

In conclusion, I think the author is right. Venus is dangerous and i think NASA should not study it.       ",3
0514ba2,"Is the Electoral College fair and right? This system is composed of the selection of the electors, the meeting of electors, and the counting of congress. This systen includes various methods like the ""winner take all"" system that gives the presidency to the winning candinate of the eletors votes. One very important thing in this system is trust, you have to trust the electors that you voted for to make the right choice. This system of eletor votes is very useful for picking the country's leaders.

The winner take all method is very intresting indeed. The electoral votes decide who wil get what, who will win. Popular vote in no longer in ""session"" or popular, the electoral votes decide it now. For example, in the 2000 election, when Gore had a lot more popular votes than Bush, but Gore had less electoral votes, it was a shocking suprise for the nation, it seemed to be like more people liked Gore than Bush. One very important thing to consider is ... the reason why Bush won, there is a huge diffrence between making a good choice, aka Gore, and and making the right choice, aka Bush!

Trust, its possibliy one of the most hard things to do in life, but in this system its necessary. Its very significant that you put your trust in the slate of people's hands that you and a whole variety of woried people selected. Trust should not just be handed oveer like anything, its should be earned just like respect, vote in the candinate that you trust.

Popular vote is kind of fair in a way because we can all vote like independent citizens.

Sometimes the electoral candinates vote against the people that elected for them and go for what they think is right which in no case is incorrect but a hudreds of citizens were counting on them to make their choice. We all have a voice, we have to use it in the fair way, and the righthous way is mostly a popular vote, but popular vote is not as efficent as eletoral votes.

The Electoral College is right but not fair, althought it has its benifets, its has its defaults as well. In the end we all decide our own fate, but together we must work together to rebuild what has been broken. We must decide on the correct, on the right leader, the leader that will make great choices for us, the leader that will lead this unique, beautiful, and magnificent country to greatness like never befroe seen, and we must be there with that leader every step of the way. Not everyone will expericence greatness but we sure will be part of it!!    ",3
051c46a,"Dear senator,

I have done research and I would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States. Source 1: ""What is electoral College?"" explains that ""each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" Many people do not know what that really means. It means that the people of the United States do not actually vote for who their president will be. They are voting for someone who gets to choose who the president will be. Having the Electoral College is very confusing. I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of electios that then choose the president.

By getting rid of the Electoral College, the vote for the United States president will be more fair. We, the people of the United States, would not be voting for a slate of electors. We would actually be voting for who we want to become our president. These votes would be more direct and accurate.

Source 2: ""Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states that voters may get confused and vote for someone that they didnt want to vote for. The people should be the ones voting for their president. It is unfair that only the electors get to vote in the end. Voters of the electors cannot even control who the electors vote for. The people have to put their trust in the electors to vote for the president. It make smore sense for the people to have a say and for them to have the ability to vote directly.

When I turn eighteen and I am allowed to vote, I hope that my vote actually matters. I hope that my vote does not just go towards an elector. I hope that my vote will count towards whom I think will represent our country well.       ?    ",3
053fa01,"The structure on Mars is just a natural landform. In 1976 the first picture was taken and it looked like a face. In 1998 scientists took another picture but this time with better quality, but people still believed it was a human face. In 2001 the people at NASA took another picture with even better quality that clearly showed that it is just a landform, or a mesa. It could of been created by Martians, or naturaly formed. Simlar structures are on the Earth called mesa and butte usually are seen in the American.

The structure on Mars is just a natural landform, because over the years scientists have developed better cameras to get a better look at the structure. After years of studying and getting higher quality pictures, they came to the conclusion that the structure is just a landform, or a mesa. It was a big trend in grocery stores, radio talk shows, and even Hollywoof films, for 25 years!

Scientists also include to support their statement that if there were airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, that you could see them because the quailty of the camera was so good. So if you could see small structures on Mars, then you could see a giant human face. But some people to this day still believe that this could be a sign of Martians. This is why you should believe that there is no human head on Mars and it is just a natural landform.",3
0545b94,"This Facial Action Coding System is weird. Why would anyone want to know what someone else is feeling or how their emotions are? To me that is personal information that I would want to myself. Plus I doubt that there would be a whoe lot a people who would put money into this to just see what emotion they are. That is just me though. What do you think about this idea? Would you spend time and money on it to just see your emotions and what mood you were in? I wouldn't.

If you keep reading from now on I am going to argue why this is a bad idea, because it is. I mean who would spend any type of time, effort, or money on this just to see what your emotions are or how you are feeling. Honestly who wants to know what facial expressions to use to show that you are happy, I think we already know how to be happy. We dont need a machine to tell us how to look happy. Obviously when someone is happy something great has happened to them or in their lives and they have a great big smile on their face. We also know when someone is mad, obviously when someone is mad they don't like to talk very much, and usually look like they are about to punch you in the face. For example in the text it shows you step by step what expression on your face we need to use to make us look happy, like no I know how to look happy or sad or mad, I don't need a machine to tell me how to do that.

So why do we need a machine to tell us these things when we already know them. Our world is just spending money on useless things and inventing usless things that our world today doesn't need. There is literally no point to the invention. Plus I don't think strangers would want us to calculate their emotions and how they are feeling right now. I mean those things are personal we don't know what their life is like or what they have been through.

To me this is what I am thinking. Is this really what they are spending our money on. The taxes we pay and all the bills we have to pay and they are speding it on these types of silly, usless inventions. Why? Just think, out of the whole world how many of us are going to use this? How many of us have the money to use it? How many of us would think its a great idea? Probably very, very, very few of us in the whole world would use this invention.

That is my take on this Facial Action Coding System. I dont like the idea of it. I think it it useless and would very seldom be used. What do you think? Do you agree with me, or not with me? Would you use it? Would you spend the money on it? Would you want someone to know how you are feeling and the emotions you are going through?",3

As stated in the sixth paragraph, '' However, peering at Venus form a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on groud conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.''

Also in the fifth paragraph, it was stated that '... temperatures would still be toasy around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.'' The wind and atmosphere and both something us humans would not be able to handle, even the spacecrafts dont survive. It was stated in the seccond passage, '' since no spacecraft survived the landing is more than a few hours.'' The conditions of this planet are just not living conditions or spacecraft areas.

Stated in the third paragraph that the ''atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.'' ''... the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit'', that is extreamly hot, a human in that hot temperature would fry.

Regaurdless of it, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He states, and i quote '' Striving to meet the challenge presented b Venus has value, not oly because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will liekly lead us into many equality intimidating endavors.''

054e4c8,"The face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. Contrary to popular belief, it is just a rock formation that coincidentally looks like a face. Scientists figure it is just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia.

The scientists at NASA made it a priority to obtain a clear photo of the face on Mars, due to the unlikely possibility that it is in fact, an alien artifact, for which they wanted a clear answer. When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, it snapped a photo, much clearer than the one obtained by the Viking. When the photo surfaced online, it proved to be nothing but a natural landform. However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy. The photo obtained on April 8, 2001 was a phenomenal photo, which proved the face on mars to be a mesa, nothing but a happy accident, you could say. Conspiract theorists also believe that NASA is hiding evidence from the general public, which is absurd. A discovery like that of an ancient alien civilization on Mars would benefit NASA.

0550fb1,"What is The Electoral College? It is a process the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified cirizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors. Most states use a ''winner-take-all'' method that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Electoral College is the method we use for voting and selecting our president's.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Therefore I think that we should change to a popular vote. Over 50 percent of the people agreee, and I think that should be enough proof. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

The problem with the electoral college is that?you?voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, wwho in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate. The slate containing 34 Democratic electors pleged to Kerry. Most likely those voters would probably win the election because Texas is a big state and a high percentage of the people voted Kerry.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Just as Romney was a solid regional in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states. This causes the method to be difficult to chose a for sure winner. Usually elections are always close.

The Electoral College restores some of that weight in the pollitical balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The method may turn off potential voters. Especially for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California. I think that we should changeb to a popular vote?method. Either way, people should be encouraged to vote because every vote counts.    ",3

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence. ",3

There are alot of schemes now a days regarding the government, our Electorals can just get paid off to promote one president but then vote for another.

Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.""? I mean not only is the Electoral college unreliable but it is also confusing to some.

Another thing i would like to address in source 3 ""Big States"" Richard says "" A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state doess..."" Exactly, if we do popular votes, candidates can just go to states and try to win them over as oppossed to Electorals taking claim of one state .

Also in the article it says the author even reasoned ""it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars"".

The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon.

On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument.

To begin with, limiting car usage would help keep a healthy, clean enviroment.

Which shows that less car usage would help protect our enviroment. Not only the enviromental agency, but the government and people agree. Also in the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert states that ""the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruling French part to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" giving us the fact that th esmog from the cars was hurting the eviroment and causing smog and reckless driving.

In the article, 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert Duffer says that ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined-diesles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" We all know diesles an expensive gas, that more than half of France has to pay for just to get from place to place. It also proves that reckless driving and smog from cars can cause damage to someones pockets with fines.

Lastly, reduced driving can help people within the same community, get to know eachother better because your either riding around on a bike or walking, giving you the chance to associate with your neighborhood friends. As stated in the article 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' , ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resteraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" which shows that driving had good aspects and helped the communty get along more.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth. This pressure can crush a submarine. The temperature can liquefy many metals. Venus has eurpting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Venus is now an inhospital to any form of life.

Human curiosity drives scientist eagerly to explore this planet despite of the many danger is upholds. Many scientist believe that Venus could have a been able to support life long time ago. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus.

NASA is trying to still pursuit solutions to these challenges so that human might actually have a chance to explore this dangerous but amazing planet.

The state legislatures are more responsible than us as voters so probably our vote doesnt really matter. Also the elctoral college truly dont pay attention to the problems about the votes and states that dont have a spark of hope that arent effected by the election but in elections it gives the chance as voters to express that political knowledge and background who would be best as our president.

This being said, scientists are still fascinated by Venus, as it could have been just like Earth long ago.

Even getting to Venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. Furthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. A vehicle hovering Venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions. Even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working everyday to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. For example, NASA has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus-like conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. Another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. They could be made to withstand the conditions of Venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study.

Although there are many challenges that need to be overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to Venus, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the discoveries it could hold. From regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface. ",3
05b31a1,"Venus is rather uninhabitable, or is it?

Although dangerous, one would not say uninhabitable, as that implies it is impossible. the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Discusses how it is perfectly plausible, and even worth it! That is, only if we have the correct equipment to do so.

Now while there are dangers, such as sulfiric acid clouds, metal melting heat, earthquakes, lightning strikes, volcanoes, and the mechanism shattering atmospheric pressure (Paragraph 3), you may ask ""Why go through the trouble if the conditions are so horrible?"". The reason is that it was so much like earth long ago, oceans and rock formations, even theoretical life!

NASA is helping with this idea via brainstorming for ideas to study venus, the first is to hover above it, avoiding all the surface problems, and still being close. The only issue, as provided by the author, wouldnt work, because while they would be in the air, the clouds would be too thick to allow anything, thus rendering the idea useless.

Another NASA idea is to use different electronics, like simpler models, and having them TAILORED for venus, such models lasted up to 3 weeks even! If those do not work, instead of moving foreward in our electronics, NASA would move back, back to the 1940s with mechanical computers, levers and gears computing what a normal computer could quicker and better, but while the mechanical option is slower, it is MUCH more durable.

With all of these ideas, I feel the author did an outstanding job supports this idea, and I support it whole-heartedly, it may be possible in the coming years, as our technology rapidly evolves, so do we, what do you think?",3
05c8b2d,"The face on mars is a rock formation. No aliens made it. We have seen it and belive that it is just a mesa. And we dont want to freak people out. Some people are against nasa and sa that it is aliens. Here is why

In 1976 are satilite the viking 1 was orbiting mars and takeing pictures of the planet. When we looked at them we noticed this one. A picture of a face on mars. When we noticed it eas just a mesa in the face. When some people herad about it they thoght it was aliens who made that. We then told them that it was just a mesa that when the shadows hit it it made it look like a face. And that nasa's budget wish there was an ancient civleization on mars. Ther is some like this one in the west. ONe is the middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. Some people say that nasa is hideing that there is life on mars and they say there is not.

So that is why we are telling people that it is a mesa. We don't want them to freak out that aliens excicst when they do not . We also wish there was an acient civilization on mars. In conclusion it s just a rock formation. That was there for a long time that shadows made us think it was a face. ",3
05c94e5,"Studying Venus

Planets are a very interesting, Earth, Mars , Venus, and others are all planets in the solar system. Venus is an interesting one, and one that not much is known about. This is why Venus must be explored and have discoveries made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why that is. The planet Venus would save time while visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made.

Venus is worth being studied because it is one of the closer planets to Earth. It is a planetary neighbor to earth. In the article ,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states,"" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Par. 4).Because Venus is a closer planet to Earth time could be saved and there would not be a worry about time being lost as if traveling to a different planet.

Secondly, Venus has similarties to Earth, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Par. 4). Just like on Earth Venus also includes the same quality land features. Going to Venus and discovering the way the land features form would be a magnificent thing to discover and being able to see how the earthquakes and natural disasters appeasr.

Lastly, while exploring Venus, reasoning for the temperatures and dangers of Venus could possibly be prevented. If someone was to discover how to prevent the dangerous factors then maybe there would not be a problem to land on Venus. Making that discovery is important and would help scientists learn more about Venus. The article states,"" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth""(Par. 3). Taking time to discover Venus could be a great thing.

Although Venus is a dangerous Planet with crucial temperatures, exploring the planet could be very beneficial to scientists and multiple discoveries could be made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why it is. The planet Venus would save time when visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made. Contributing to the study of Venus may be challenging, but in the end would be quite beneficial and would make a difference. ",3
05e6736,"A driverless car? Now that's ridiculous. How are you suppossed to get your licenses when you're older? People are going to depend on manufacturer cars. I think this is unnessesary because the future generation isn't going to learn how to drive an actual real car. Cars that humans can actually drive.

In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Flordia, and even the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Yeah, it's okay to have driverless cars around, but only for certain emergencies. Driverless cars can even take over people's jobs! And what are those people going to do without a job?

If the technology fails and someone is injured, who's at fault the driver or the manufacturer? Probably the driver because he or she didn't took over when the emergency was occuring. And what if that certain person didn't have a license? Even though traffic laws change we are still not garunteed that we will be safe inside a driverless car. New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident.

In conclusion, we are still going to be in risk. I still think it's a ridiculous idea. I predict that they are going to be more accidents than they are in regular cars. The road to autonomous cars stretches on over the years. We are growing closer and closer to the destination every day. Do you think driverless cars will take over? ",3
05fa43a,"Using this technology that could read emotional expressions of students is very valuable. Imagine someone acting to be really happy with a big smile in their face, and then actually being upset about something. The article had a lot of possitive points about this technology.

A lot of people would say no to this technology because they are getting checked by a computer. Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling. It can calculate how you feel just by constructing your face and seeing how all 44 mucles of your face are.

Dr. Huang says ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresion."" He is trying to say that even when people try to change the way their face acts. The computer may still know how your actual emotions are. These new technology is so amazing because it can even be on your own PC.

Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. These new technology can actually calculate every emotion. Even if it is in the past.

All these amazing things about this technology should be valuable in classroom. The students would be able to study new things about how this actually works. How it can make everyone feel better about it. The students actually doing this things with these technology would actually make them a bit happier. This is why this technology that reads expressions should be valuable in a classroom. ",3
05ff7b3,"Now you can actually know how thye feel by an app. This is now something that is being used to recognise the emotions of old paintings and it might actually be good for people. it will be able to tell how you really feel, it can hlp kids in school. and it also helps produce emotions.

We all know someone that says they are fine but they think something else, but we cant fingure out how they also feel. But with this new program it will be way easier and that is a good thing. ""the software can even identifiy mixed emotions.... each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)."" Since this software can tell peoples emotions it could help in therapy with things, like if a person comes in for therapy but says they feel good about it but they dont act like it the therapist could do this test and see what they are having trouble with or how they really feel about the subject at hand.

Some kids can get bored in school and just zone out because the material they are being taught does not click with them but that can be changed with this new program. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Dr. huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" this could benifit both the school system and the child. the child will be more attentive with the lesson if he or she understands it or they think it is interesting and then they might even score higher in school, and have a better futre.

Some people might just look mean when you walk by them, or it may even be you that always gets asked ""You always look mad so i dont talk to you."" nut now since this program came out, the theory that comes with it is that it can help you produce new emotions. "" According to the Facial feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them."" this can benifit poeple in many ways. They might become happier and more out going. They could have better oppertunities when it comes to work because they have a good attutide.

This new facial feedback could be really good for us as people. it could halp many peoplr in thier lifes. ",3
06041d8,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the auhtor did not make enough evidence and information on why it would be of great value to explore our twin planet, Venus. Most the article was relaying challenges, or risks, as some might say, and probable solutions to those risks. The part in the article on why it would be of great value to study Venus does not give us a lot of reason why.

For most of the articel the author was giving was reasons why there unmanned missons to visit and why a single spaceship has not touched down on Venus in more than three decades. One reason as he explain was Venus's atmosphere. Another was the enivornment of our neighboring planet Venus.

Mostly the other part of the article was soltuions to Venus's challenges. He talk about how NASA had an idea to use an blimp-like trasnportation to avoid Venus's harsh enivorment. He also explained NASA's othe plan to use mechanical computers some modern technology wouldn't burn up and melt due to Venus very humid temperatures.

At the end of the article, in the last paragraph, is where the author briefly gave he reason for why studying Venus would be a good idea. He brings up recieveing insight on the planet. Also he brings up the hunger human curiosity and that it will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Based on the information explained in this essay, the reason is now known why the author did not do a good job supporting why explorating Venus would be of great value. He mainly just explains the challenges and solutions to explore Venus. Hardly anything is say on why the value of studying Venus would be of great use. ",3

I believe that it is i good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring to you, help you understand what you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

One reason why it is a good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring for you. The computer can help find a video or something that can help the work be for fun or extced for you. For example, say that I do not like math or i can not figure out what the answer is because i am bored the computer can find a video to help me.

Another reason, is it can help you learn something you do not know. For example say the teacher does not explain a problem correctly and so the computer looks up a video or something that can explain the problem.

Last reason, is the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

For example the computer will look at your face and will see that you can not do a problem and sees your frustration and the computer will look uo an article,video,etc.. that will help you and it will give you instuctions on how to do something.

In conclusion, as you can see the technology to read the emotinal expressions of student's is a great idea because it can help you something that boring to you, help you understand something that you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.            ",3
0607ed1,"Dear senator,

I would like to say that the electoral college is not what we should be using to elect our presidents. I think the electoral college is not what Americans need. In the electoral college process, many thing could go wrong. The system does not work as many people think it does, as it is very deciving and unfair. Over half of all voters agreed that we should abolish the system and go by popular vote.

The electoral college is unfair due to the fact that peoples vote is not even going to the president but for his electors. The biggest moral of the country is ""we the people"" have control. The trickery of the electoral college is not allowing this to happen but taking it away. It is mainly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. The electoral college interfered in the the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush by allowing Bush to win even though more people voted on Al Gore in popular vote.

The many flaws in the system or mistake that can happen are more likely in the electoral college. The is a possibility that the two presidents can tie and in which case they have to go through a long process. This can happen due to an even number of electoral votes overall (538). The electors in the state of Louisiana have refused to vote for their party's canidate and vore for whoever they please ant that is not right. You can pay electors to vote one way which is also wrong too considering that not what the people think.

Many people agree that they system should be abolished including two presidents the united states Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Over half of all voters at over 60% agree that the system should be abolished. These statistics were taken in a Gallup Poll in 2000 shortly after Al Gore was not elected. The Obama vs. Romney race was won by Obama who had 61.7 % of the electoral votes versus he had only 51.3 % of the popular votes.

That's it! The electoral college is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"" as Bradford Pulmer clearly staes it. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis of reality. Due to the many flaws and/or mistakes that can happen the electoral college should not be used. I have to agree with Nixon and Carter: ""Abolish the Electoral college!""       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",3
0608495,"The future is coming. Many new technologies will be developed over the next few years, and ideas that people have had for decades will finally have the possibility of becoming a reality. Flying cars, human-like robots, anything you can possibly imagine could very well be introduced into our future.

Although many new problems will arise with these new developments, setbacks such as driving/traffic laws, or the argument of who would be at fault in case of an accident will only be a ripple in the ocean that is our technology. These devices should most definitely be tested for years to come before they even begin to release it into the population, but in the end, I certainly agree that they could furiously enhance our style of living, and ultimately, safety for those around us.

For any of these ideas to become a reality, there is going to have to be many years of testing ahead, and many trials and errors, but in order for the human race to move forwards, as it has in the past, there are always risks and precautions that need to be taken, and warnings that we must heed. In the pass, countless lives have been taken in the name of science and technology, and I highly doubt that as we move forwards into our future, that will change much. People will always struggle to further the comfort of their living, even if that means taking from other people. It makes me wonder if technology such as this is actually going to be beneficial for our society. As I think about the health risks and funding needed for advances such as these, not to mention the threat of war from other countries, I begin to realize that maybe we will reach a point in the future where technology will no longer be beneficial to us, but instead, be counterproductive in the overall wellbeing of the world.

When all the facts are laid before me, with no deceit hidden behind fine print, only then will I believe that technological advances can only bring good into this world. Even today, it is becoming more and more apparent that social media and cellphones have altered our way of communication. No longer do we have to go outside to see people, or have conversations face to face, so that means that our world has become much smaller, yet also much bigger at the same time. Human confrontation may be a rare thing in thirty years, maybe even five. Although I, and most anyone else, enjoy the comfort of our technologies and lifestyle right now, there will most definitely come a time, maybe in the near future, where we regret pushing to try to make our life easier. Only time will tell when people begin to discover new ways to harm others, and when that time comes, we will regret ever pushing this far. ",3
0608fab,"In the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" Have many advantages, but i feel that the main advantage is that it is good for the planet and to lower air pollution and aslo the movement is actually working.

Helping out the planet and staying green in some way is a good thing because it helps our planet look better not only that it makes it look better but it also makes us humans and the planet Earth healthier for example the air pollution can be lowered by driving cars less,instead od driving your own car you could take the bus,walk, or ride like in the text it says

""Its's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""

Another advantage could be that the movement is working

All in all this passage have many good advantages to help persuade people to start driving less and helping out our planet, One it is good for our planet because no one wants to live in a dirty place, Two it will help lower the bad air pollution, and Lastly is that the movement is working anyways so why not try and help out and drive a little less?       ?       ?

060d2bb,"Everyone think's that it is a face that was created by aliens but its not. The thing that appears to be a face is not a face it is simply a natural landform. It is a natural landform because on April 5, 1998, global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a photo of the so called alien artifact. Their photo was ten times better than the original Viking photo so that meant they could get a better view out of it. After looking over the photo they found out that is was no alien arttifact.

But people were not satisfied. So on april 8, 2001 a summer day in Cydonia the global surveyor drew closer for a second look. As they rolled the spacecraft 25 degress to the center of the

face they took an extrordinary photo. Using the cameras absolute maximum resolution for the photo. That means for each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

You can discern things in a digital photo 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So that means if the human lookin landform was an alien artifact u would be able to see airplans on the ground.

0613e60,"My position on driverless cars is that it is a dumb idea. It is not likley we will have them, right now they can only get up to 25 miles per hour. That is not a very fast car or at least not fast enough. We would have to change the speed limits, people would not be able to get to work on time. These are reasons I think the idea is stupid.

25 miles per hour is not a very fast car or at least not fast enough. Think about this, mostly all of our speed limits get up to 30 to 35 miles per hour. so what i am saying is that all the construction that would have to take place would be over whelming. In the text it said the car has a warning system to alert drivers about construction or wrecks. the system would be going crazy.

People would not be able to get to work on time. When a car we use now verses a ""smarter"" car the problems would be reliability and speed. In a modern day car we can sync our phones to them and have gps tell you where to go. If a modern car runs out of gas on the highway you can pull over, locate and walk to the nearest gas station with a gallon container and get more gas, then you could walk back to your car and put the gas in your car. Now with a ""smarter"" car it comes with a gps system, sure. If the ""smarter"" car however runs out of energy your navigation system will not work, and you would have to, in some way shape or form, get your car to a charging station then you will have to wait a while before its charged up and ready to go.

In conclusion those are the reasons I toatly dissagree with people that want ""smarter"" cars on the road. You can not rely on them . They are dumb and will not be able to function properly in todays society.",3

Teenagers hide alot of emotions for multiple reason. Simply because it can lead to alot of questioning about their life. Not everyone would want people to know what goes on in their life that makes them depressed or sad.

Eckman classified 6 basic emotions - happiness, suprise , anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Why would anyone want anyone else to know if they'er sad or disgusted? What if you was talking to some one and they had an awful smell . Then , the Facial Action Coding System just show how disgusted you are. That would not only hurt the other person's feelings but make you feel mean.

Dr. Huang noted ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" ""So computer need to understand that , too"" . Most human are nonverbal because they chose not to be. Not every one just want to sit not and talk about their feelings. Also, Dr. Huang noted , ""So computers need to understand that , too. Understand what? How might a computer understand?

The future is here and it's time to quit holding these new inventions off and time to start accepting that the worlds technology today is limitless. People in our world today are becoming so intellegent that they can invent anything they set thier minds to.

First of all, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900's, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come.

Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and thier dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the drivers seat of an actual moving vehical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true.

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

0640183,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author Nick D'Alto desribes how a new technologhy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion changes . Human changes are when a person can feel a little happy ,but more sadder. In this essay today I will explain how I think whether the use of the technology should be used in the classroms , based off what iv'e just read .

Based off what i just read in the text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile "" the author Nick, was explaining about how the emotion changes to Mona Lisa expressed how she felt based off cacualations using technology. In the beginning of the txet the author talked about the caculations emotions .For an example in the text text the author quoted "" She's 83 perenct happy, 9 perecnt disgusted ,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science

teacher , grading your lastest lab assignment . "" After , reading that example, you should have a question asking "" How did they know that "" ? .The answer to that question is rare , they knew how much percentages of each emotion was worth

because they caculated it using technology and her body strcutered muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus. That helps shows the crow-feet aroud the eyes to vertify the emotions ; bsaed off body languages.

I feel that classroms need this computred based technology because it'll tell the teacher wether if a student is feeling good, bad, or okay . I know this because according to the text the author Nick was explaing the caculations of Mona Lisa . It explained her emotions and even the percentages of the emotions. I can connect this to when I was in 3rd grade. I was getting ready for the ISAT test. That day i was not feeling good, I was feeling 80 perecnt worries , 5 perent happy, and 25 percent sad. I did not move to the next grade all because of i was worried about how will I do on the test instead of getting it out the way . My teacher couldn't tell my emotions because my emotions was hidden in silence . That's why I feel this technonlogy should be used in classrooms, but if it is being used in the classroms I hoep it change the looks at things .

After, reading my essay I hope you get a good understanding why iv'e thought it was best to have the technology in classrooms . The caculations will explain how each student is feeling each day of class. The computer will show the progress of an happy , sad , worried, or okay student . A student actions and emotions explains their feelings ,but not the percentages. However, I hope teachers and instructors chose to have the computer based technology to explain a students emotions.         ",3

Cutting back on usage of car can save you a lot of money and prevent accidents from happening. when there are less cars on the road it reduces accidents with bikers, walker, and other cars. when you are involved in a car accident you someone gets hurt and you lose money. car accidents are costly. the insurance goes up, your medical bill has to be paid, the gas you used or lost, and your out of work because of you injury. that's just part of it. you have to still think about the damage you caused and have to live knowing you killed or could have killed an innocent person. money loss doesn't happen just when your in an accident. just by being a safe driver u lose money also. having a car means having to deal with insurance, mechanic, and gas. gas prices are very expensive now in days. sometimes you have to skip a meal because you only have enough for gas that day. cutting back could save you hundreds yearly even if u cut back maybe two times a week. just think about it you can prevent an accident from happening and save money just by staying home,walking, or riding a bike.

Saving money and preventing car accidents is not the only reasons you should cut back on car usage. another reason is because it hurts our environment. for every car that is being used our environment is being hurt. a car lets off bad gasses that cause the green house affect. this is not just hurting the area that we live in its also hurting other areas all over the world. the gasses that cars make is making our world heat up and ice and glaciers are getting defrosted. this harms the polar bears and causes water levels to rise and less land for us. cutting back on usage of cars can help not just us as people but our plants and animals all over the world. if u don't want to do it for the world do it for your self. cutting back and using a bike, walking or public transportation can be good for you. using a bike and walking is good exercise for you and can be a weekly thing. using public transportation can help you meet new people and make friends and get to know people. cutting back doesn't really have to be weekly even if its just one or twice every other month can still really help. if you have the choice to stay and cook or go out and eat then try to stay home and hey who knows maybe you can learn a new recipe.

Cutting back can save a life, our environment, save money, and be a healthy thing. just think about all those cute polar bears and other animals you could be saving. oh, lets not forget the plants also. just plan a day that you will just ride your bike to work and on your ride think of all the good things your doing for our community so go ahead save the environment, save your self.    ?

0667fd7,"Scientist believe they have came up with a technology that can read your true emtions called FACS, or Facial Action Coding System. This technology works your emotions out like a math equation. It calculates the feelings of fear, happiness, disgust, surprise, anger, and sadness. Now they are thinking that it can be great in the classroom and benefit schools tremendously.

Feeling are told all over your face and your body language, all someone really has to do is pay attention. In the classroom though, it is very hard for one teacher to see how each child individually feels. New technology that has sprung up can do that for them now. This technology uses video memory and software that decodes the muscles in facial expressions. This could be very beneficial in the classroom because now you can see how your children feel about your lessons, and that could develope new ways to help students learn. The auhtor writes how Dr. Huang says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". ""Then it could modify the lesson like, like an effective human instructor."", this would be very wise to put in a classroom. Teachers want to know all the time what they can do for their students and how; new technology could do it for them.

Although this idea could be genius, it could have flaws just like most technology. It is hard to truly depict someones emotions, so how can a computer tell someone how they feel? Or honestly, what does a few pieces metal know about how someone is feeling? People could also say this creation is very invasive.These claims could be arguements presented when getting this type of technology into the classroom.

Even though this technology could have flaws to it,

people will never kbow till they try. They have sent pyschologists, like Dr.Paul Eckman, in to help perfect the FACS. The computer software can even predict your true emotions, regardless if you put on a fake smile. It knows what muscles are used in a fake and in a real smile. Humans use the same skill everyday according to the author, our only difference is we have trouble actually describing the emotion.

In conclusion, FACS, a system that can calculate your feelings, would be a great additon to the classroom. We introduce new technology everyday that is not benefical to schools, so why not help the school sytem. Every technology has its kinks, but who truly knows until it is tested.",3

06743f8,"As we all know driverless cars are coming. Do you agree with idea? and would you feel comfortabel ina driverless car?. Well im here to discuss with you why I don't think driverless cars are needed.

The idea of having a driverless car is a fantastic idea until you begin to think about the consequences and similarities it has against cars we drive now. There's many differences but also a lot of similarities between both the driverless cars and the cars we drive now.

Driverless cars are not a good because why create a car that drives on its own but still needs assistance from a person. Driveless cars does come with special sensors such as; position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor, but with all that technology why does it need assistance. The cars we drive today does not have all that fancy sensoring but it does have some that really comes in handy. Driverless cars can steet, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as; navigating through work zones and around accidents. To save the stress of you having to take control of the wheel if you run into a problem than why not keep you car, the cars we drive now. Without any navigation or all that fancy stuff we will always have our eyes on the roads and knowing when to turn, stop, go and all that good stuff.

No matter how good a driverless car sounds I still don't think its a god idea. I feel as if its just a waist of money and products when there's more importnat things going on in the world that still hven't been fixed. Driverless cars are safe until a drunk driver or a persons who's high off something get in a dosen't pay attention to what that navigator is telling you, the same with texting and driving. So why risk someone lives when if they are driving the cars we use now more people pay attention to the roads, not many drink and drive, more and more people everyday are paying attention to the roads. ",3
06766be,"In a argument between against or for driverless cars, I am for driverless cars. I think it's a good idea to have driverless cars. It will safer on the streets. There

should be a whole new set of laws regarding to these cars. I also think they shouldn't be released until these cars are truly driverless.

As I said earlier driverless cars shouldn't come out until they are completely do not need a driver. When they are driverless it would resolve conflict between if there were an accident who the blame would be on. The blame would be on the company that made the car because the driver isn't doing anything. I think there should still be a mode in the car where the driver can takeover if the driver sees a situation where he should control the car. I think the car should be smart enough to know how to get through traffic jam, that shouldn't be a problem. The new laws should be that all cars will have to go a certain speed. I don't see how you could get in a car accident if they are all going the same speed. Even though most people would have a driverless car, some people will still have old cars that need a driver. So if there is an accident between a driverless car and a old car that requires a driver, I think the blame should be in the driver in the old car because the driverless car is following all the laws and is going a certain speed so if there was an accident it would be on the driver that isn't following the laws. But then again the driverless car could have technical difficulties and could crash. I think the car should know when it is having technical issues and pull over to the side so the driver can take control. Even though the car is driverless I think the laws for getting your license should not change. Also some people like to drive so the should be and option that is opposite to cruise control we the driver can drive, but when you are driving you have to be ready to take responsibility for anything that happens while you are driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a great idea. It would lead to less accidents as long as the car it programmed the right way. Texting and driving would be as big of an issue as it has been lately with a driverless car. With a driverless car there are less choices being made and less opinions. Our generation would be great to take on the challenge because we take on new things everyday with things being invented everyday. With all that being said I am for driverless cars. It is a great idea and would save lives also. ",3
0681136,"Many believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. There are many conspiracy theories, but scientists say the Face is simply just a natural landofrm. Cydonia was first discovered in May of 2001, and since then has had people baffled by the human-like structure. Though it may be easy to believe that this landform is the creation of aliens on Mars, it is just a natural rock formation on the red planet.

Aliens not been proven to be living in the universe with a secret ancient civilization. Though some people might believe this is untrue, NASA has yet to find evidence to support it. If scientists knew Cydonia was created by aliens, they would definetly want to investigate this further. With this new information, just like any new discovery, it would open up so many different ideas about the universe that do not exist today. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger thatn the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" With the extremely advanced technology we have today, scientists have been able to take more pictures of this landform, further proving that it is a natural creation, and that there is no alien civilization hiding in the depths of it's shadows.

Cydonia has many conflicting opinions on how it was created. Many citizens still strongly hold on to their ideas about this landform. It has been proved by NASA that this formation is not created by aliens, nor is there any living organisms with secret colonies on Mars. People have the choice to believe what they want, but scientists know the truth behind the Face on Mars. ",3
0683ac3,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valubale in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. In paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. It would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. In paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could know and then ask them whats wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. It could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. In paragraph 6, the author states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it help tell how students are feeling. Also it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions. Next time you see a facial expression try telling what emotion that it applies to.",3
068ad55,"Changing to election by popular vote for the president is a wonderful idea. By doing this you persuade more people to go out and vote. The people of the united states will now have a bigger impact on the state that they live in. Doing this not only makes the people happy, but it also makes the people more involved. With this new rule in place many things can change and improve. People will actually have to do a little research before voting on a president.

Firstly, Changing to election by popular vote for the president can cause a chain reaction. With this new rule the people of the United States will be forced to do solid research before making a vote that will benifit them. Reason being that with this new rule in place your vote is much more crucial then it was before. Doing this stops people from voting just because they like how someone looks, or because how they dress. The people will be voting because they want a president that will help the country. Using this method will improve and shape the country in an wonderful way.

Lastly, this new rule will cause more people to come out and vote. Because each vote will be ten times more essential then it was before. People come out knowing that if they dont vote, it will have a much bigger impact then it did before. The people are forced to decisions. This make for a healthy country that is made for the people.

All in all, Voting should be much more essential. Therefor i agree to changing to election by popular vote for the president. this new rule makes for a very healthy country. this rule also causes the people in the country to be much more involved.

068aea7,"Driverless cars should not become a thing. Humans should continue to drive themselves around or walk to where they want to go. They do not need a computer to do all the driving for them as cool and futuristic as it might seem.

Although be driven by a computer in your own car may seem safe and trustworthy, but it's not. There are a lot of negative down falls on not having control of a car as a human. Being driven by computer car can be very dangerous, it is not safe to not be driven by someone with a right mind. Computers can't do everything. Why would a human want to be driven by a car instead of a human? What if a person wants to change the route that they are going, it's not like they would be able to tell the computer to go another way. Humans should have more controll over their car rather than a computer.

Humans are becoming so lazy that they do not even want to drive for themselves andymore. If they want to be driven for they should get a taxi or have their own personal driver. Buying a driverless car would

be just as expensive as hiring a driver. Driverless cars can be very dangerous for others on the rode. Perhaps something should go wrong with the computer and it begins to glitch. That would be a very dangerous situation. No human should depend on a computer to drive them around.

No human should want to own a driverless car unless they are willing to take the full risk. It would not be a good idea to have computers driving around major cities that have a lot of traffic.         ",3
06939ab,"Athough cars are an important part of everyday life driverless cars would be an influeintial addition to public and private transportation.Driverless cars would help traversing through traffic easy.

The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and pffer far more flexibility than a bus. he belives such cars would fundamentally change the world."" This would be usefull to people around the globe who don,t have cars or cant afford one. Driverless cars can be an important pat of sociaty.

""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars...manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" This Exert from the passage supports my claim that they should only be aloud to be driven if they are fully tested and safe. Laws have been passed in some states to make this sure to happen.

In conclusion, I agree with Sergey Brin that driverless cars would be influeintial to the future of public and private transportation through out the world. However they should only be aloud to be driven if they safe and fully tested. Lastly I think driverless cars should be manufactured and tested thoroughly. ",3

If a student was sad then the computer woud know and it could help make a diffirence.

Some students might not want to do work if and not learn if they are sad and this could change that and put a smile on thier face. The author says, "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This could make the student have a better time in the classroom.

A student might be super confused and not know anything about what they are doing or they might just not understand the question, well this technology could help that. It says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This means if the main teachor is telling someone else in a classroom how to do a problem but other people might also be struggling then the computer could help them and see their their emotion and it would change the question to try and make it more understandable.

The technology of this could help so many students and classrooms. So much more things could be learned in classrooms with out kids getting bored.

06a0e57,"Although, self driving cars would be nice to have I would rather stick to driving manually.One reason is because we dont need driverless cars. We have taxi drivers that takes us where we need to go. Another reason is I would rather do it my self is because i enjoy driving, and I would be more than happy to take

myself where I need to go. My last reason about not wanting driverless cars because think about if they malfunction or if someone hacked into your car.

If we had driverless cars, we would be taking alot of peoples jobs that they depend on. Bus drivers, taxi drivers, shofurs would all be out of work and could now be lost in life. Not having anything other work

avalible for them becsuse they didnt go to collage or they just cant find a new job.

Another reason that

I belive we dont need driveless cars is because i enjoy driving and im sure im not the only only. But driverless cars would take the freedom feeling out of driving. Being able to go where you want, how you want, and when you want to. But what if your someone who likes to driver of roads in dirt, mud or any other terrian. The car that drives its self wouldnt do that bc it may be damaged or it may read that its a possibility of that.

My last thought on driverless cars are they have the potential to be very dangerous also its pointless to have one if you still have to be aware as if you were driving. But what if your just like antother day of you letting your car drive itself starts to have defects. A couple of those are that sometimes it rapidly picks up speed and slams on the brakes. Results you end up running someone over or you get into a bad accident. You have to take the blame for the mistake your car made. That could lead to big fines or even Jail time. Or what if someone hacks into your car and takes control of your car and try to hurt you by crashing it or they take you some where your not fimilliar with. As in they driver you out of state and you get lost.

So again I am one that is against driverless cars. they could put people out of work making peoples lifes ruined. It can take the thrill some get from driving. Also alot can go wrong if the car comes with flaws.

We helped so many people affected by the war. We took animals, food supply, and more to people whose countries were left in ruins from bombings, and other attacks of World War 2. So many people, that would have otherwise not have been able to do very well, got animals, food to feed their animals, and food for themselves. Helping them helped me to be more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all that serious though. We would play around on board, usually after all the animals had been unloaded, and we were heading back. We would have baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been kept. Table-tennis, fencing, and boxing were other sports we found a way to play. There were also things like reading, whittling, and games we used to help pass the time.

Along with our jobs, sightseeing was something we did everyday. I got a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. In Greece, I got to do something I think is pretty special. See the Acropolis. In Venice, Italy, I got to take a gondola ride on one of the many streets of water. I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal on the way to China.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy helped open up the world to me. Instead of being drafted into the military, I got to help people in need all over the world. When my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat, I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, and it really did turn out to be one!   ",3

It is just a rock formation without an alien monument. Landforms are not rare on other planets. Landforms come in all shapes and sizes so it just so happens to be a face.

When the scientist went back up to take picture and look at it more, they were able to take a clear picture of it. The scientist then blew it up to a bigger picture and saw that it was a natural landform. It states,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than a pixel size."" This comes to show that they will be able to see things closer and see if anything is around them. It also tell us that it actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa, which is landforms that are normal around the American West. It states,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho."" This tell us that it really is not something an alien could of done because it is a natural landform just like America has.

All of this evidence comes to show that it is just a landform that was created naturally. Mars landforms look like ours and is like ours. We have landforms that are different and so does Mars so it was just a coincedence that it just so happened to be a face. Some people think that just because it is a face that was created by Aliens because it looks to much like a face, but landforms come in all shapes and sizes. It is just a natural landform.",3

Sence the day of that picture all of us working in NASA tried to find out what was that. It did have a great impact to NASA because if someone else saw the picture, it will make panic to the audience and the world.

So all those years we studied mars and it's land's forms to see if there were others that look a like. We didn't find other that look a like so people start to make their own ideas of the face.

Most people though that was made for aliens, but it wasn't. We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.

NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not.

So we decided to show it to the world because it was just a mesa. People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc.

06c7026,"The Face on Mars is just a landmark. I can tell you this because you can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming.

You can't believe anybody that has no real evidence. In paragraph five it says that ""evidence that NASA would rather have."" That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential. People thing the face is evidence of life on Mars and the Face is bona fide so they are saying there has to be life on Mars. In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about. This is evidence of why you can't believe anything without true evidence.

NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that. This is evidence of why NASA won't leak anything so people do not know the truth.

If NASA won't leak anything then everyone is just assumimg. ""The Face on Mars has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" It has been in movies okay and they change it up a little bit to make it interesting and people think that is the true story. NASA wishes there was ancient civilization background on Mars so they know the full details. NASA doesn't even know the full story of the The Face, so how can people be for sure about anything. These are examples of why people are just assuming.

People think it is a face that aliens put on there. So you are saying if I go out to the middle of the desert and see a face it camre from aliens. It is a natural landmark that came with the planet of Mars. NASA is not even telling people so no one even knows for sure anyways.

You can't believe anybody that has no evidence, NASA won't even leak anything, and if NASA will not tell anybody anything then everyone is just assuming. This is why this is just a landmark.

06c7ba1,"Everyday technology is changing for the better. There is a lot of contriversy about cars. Wheather they should be driverless or not. I belive that it is not a good idea for the cars to be driverless. I think this becuase humans are smarter, technology fails sometimes, and it will be too expensive. The idea of cars being driverless is scary.

Firstly, I believe that humans are smarter than any computer in the world. Humans know what is going on whereas computers dont know as much. comeputers can fail to sense something and get in bad accidents. Drivers also have better senses, computer can always fail. I belive that humans should be the only ones driving the cars.

Another reason that i think cars should not be driverless, is becuase technology always fails. What if one of the sensors fail and you loose control of the car. The artilce said that the cars arn't fully driverless, so what is the point. Also, computars can glitch and cause horrible accidents. technonlgy is not very reliable.

lastly, another reason why cars shouldn't be driverless is becuase it would cost a a lot of money. Cars will have many sensors and devises that are very expensive. The roads will also need to have some senors in them and that will cost a fortune. the cars will also need a lot of energy to keep all the sensors running, which will mean that the battery will need to be changed constantly, and batterys arn't very cheap. I belive that it will cost to much money to make the driverless car.

In conclusion, I belive that driverless cars shouldn't be made. Driverless cars will cost toom much, humans are smarter, and technology is not reliable. Driverless cars will cause alot of debt and accidents. It is pointless to make them if the driver will always need to be there taking the wheel. So the cars are not completely driverless. Driverless cars are not a good idea.      ",3

This sentece is telling the reader the truth right then and there. The face infact is formed by a natural landform, a mesa which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 2 it tells us, the readers, that scientists figured the face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia but only had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. In paragraph 8 it gives a reasonn on why maybe the alien markings showed up on the face. The camera that took the photograph of the face had to peer through a wispy cloud to see the face. Perhaps the alien figures had been caused by the cloudy surface. In paragraph 6 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim was still trying to get the truth to the people after 18 years long of the Viking mission ended.

For an example we can pet horses and what other time will you get to do that, but thats not it, when we unload the horses we can play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and many other games. As you can see we can all have tons of fun! Just imagine going on oversea voyages and going all over the world! Best of all helping the people who need our help. That would be awesome!

Now you see all these great reasons to join us! We will do so much. You can get back home with the most amzing story for your family and friends! This organization impacted me so much, at first i was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank but now i am going on oversea voyages to different countries. Once i was just an ordinary man but now i am adventurous and happy. I am Luke Bomberger and these are the reasons why i want you to join us. I want you on the Seagoing Cowboys team! Now will you join us on a adventure of a lifetime?",3
06d6248,"Would you want to be burned at 800 degrees Fahrenheit? No, that just sound to painful you might say. Scientists at NASA speculate that Venus's surface on the planet can average those temperatures. In this essay I will talk about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and evidence that backs my claim up thoroughly.

Going to another planet seems so dangerous and so far out of our mind that we don't think about this idea on a regular basis. The text states in paragraph 3, ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures avereage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouter on Earth."" This quote shows how much more dangerous Venus is than Earth just simply based on the atmosphere of the planet and that harsh conditions that cover it. Another piece of evidence is this in paragraph 4, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such asn valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of Venus seems indisputable."" This quote shows how Venus is so close geographically and distance wise to Earth based on some land features. Researchers find that getting even 30 miles from the surface of the planet the temperatures would still be at roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to Earth's sea level.

Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is so magnificant of a planet because we have never experienced a planet so much like our own. Our travels shouldn't be limited by dangers or doubts that we may have but should meet our endeavourous wonders and imagination of the planet and travel.    ",3
06ed983,"In the aricle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. Details I found from in the article show that computers can read a persons emotions. It can also tell from a painting or a video. It tells us in the beginging of the paragraph 1 that in the Mona Lisa paiting it shows emotion. According to the new computer software that can read emotions they tested it on paiting. She shows 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perecent ferful, and 2 percent angry.

I believe this new technology is valuable for our use. It can give us bettter ways to explore and to communicate with computers. It tells us in the artilcle that computers can actually ""calculate"" emotions. It can recognize how a human feels and how humans express themselves. A psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman a creator for FACS constructed a 3-D computer model of a face and all major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. One or more muscles that move is called a ""action unit"". An example, your pfrontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyues) raise your eyuebros when your surprised or shocked .

Using video imagery, the new emotion-regonition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. Humans perform this same impressice ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her or his face. I think to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom is impressive. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It could also make computer animated faces more clear and expressive for video games video surgery. But also most humans communicate in nonverbal, including emotional communicaton.

I think the use to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable. It can help them in the classroom if there confused or distracted. It could really help a lot more then just students in a classroom. I think it could be used around in daily life maybe at a hostpital or military. This is why i think the Facial Action Coding System and technology is valuable.            ",3
06ef6d4,"Many people think that the Face that was discovered on Mars might have been created by aliens. But thats far from the truth. There are many reasons why that face could have shown up there. A natural lanform maybe? Mesa? Anything but aliens.

Although there is no evidence for there being life on Mars, many skeptics say otherwise. We believe that is was just a natural lanform that was mistaken for looking like a face because the landform gives off the illusion of having eyes and a mouth. Its unusual shadow is believed to only be a mesa and many people are fascinated with it.

Some people counter will be you are hiding it because you dont think the people of the United States can handle it, or it can be too dangerous for us to comprehend. This all could be good reasons not to tell but, considering the fact that there was not evidence of life, how can there be some sort of alien? My rebuttal to these claims are it just had happened naturally and everything is going just going how it was made to be and NASA haf found positive and reasonable points that it was just made naturally.

We have different landforms made everyday and the come out looking rather unusual but that doesnt mean that there is anything out there that is capable of reaching us. If the skeptics are so sure that that was made with the possiblilities of there being aliens on Mars, then they need the statistic and evidence to support why.",3
06fa3b6,"Do you remember when the weather was mild with a slight breeze and you could go and just drive with the windows for about a year? Imagine be able to do that in a car that doesn't need your help to drive. Wouldn't it be nice to have that? I think it would and in the near future it might just be possible. They has been several motor compinies that are on tract to have a driverless model out in the year 2020.

The more you think about being able to absorb nature in a car the better it sounds. Think about driving around the Grand Canyon or taking a tour around Times Square in New York. Both seem like fun places to visit but when you are driving around rocks and trying to avoid clif edges or focusing on the traffic in front of you that may take an hour just to move one block, now that doesn't seem that enjoyable. Now in the future there is a possinbility that you could still do these things, still be in the drivers seat, but be able to look around and enjoy the sereny because your car drives itself.

Now you might be thinking that this is very dangerous and right now at this present moment it may be. However, with the way technology is advancing and the ability we have with it, driverless cars might be safer than cars driven by humans. Us humans have a tendency to always make mistakes and some of those mistakes cause injury and even death when we come to talk about motor vehicle mistakes. There has been plenty of fatal accidents casued by people not paying attetion or drinking and then trying to drive drunk which is one the stupidest mistakes someone could make in their lifetime. With the driverless car these mistakes can easily be prevented. No more do we have to not only focus on the road in front of ourselves but also to the area around us because the majority of driving is defense driving and watching out for other people. WIth these cars you don't have to worry about weather the car next to you is going to try to cut you off or if the person heading the opposite direction is going to veer off and speed into your lane. All of these cars have sensors and can detect what is around them, where they are going, when to stop, and when to go.

These cars are the cars of the future. They will be installed with the best and latest safety equipment. They will change the way of our everyday life. They will change the way we travel. These cars are coming and coming fast, they maybe be expensive at first but it won't take long before everyone has them. They may seem like a tale from a movie or a book, but they will be here before you know it , weather you are ready or not.",3
070faae,"Technology is a great thing to have in a classroom. It helps kids in many ways. It helps being able to know when a kid is struggling and the computer can go back and help the kid. The computer can do many different things. It could help with their homework. Being able to use a computer is a nice thing to have especially in the classroom, because a teacher isn't always going to be there for the child that has a question. Technology could be very productive too. Most kids like being able to use technology instead of pencil and paper. Kids engage more when they use computers.

Technology is a great resource is the classroom to have because it is hard for kids to pay attention. If you have a computer software that could recognize emotions it would help with what you need to help the kid with more. All the computer would have to do is be able to have a wide understanding of subtle facial movements with a 3-D computer model of the face. The software would have an understanding of all the 44 major muscles in the model that would need to move like the way the muscles do in a human face.

I'm very supportive with technology being used in the classroom, because if a kid cannot write it could potentially be easier for a kid if he were to type it. If a child were to have trouble than it would pick up on it from the child's facial reaction. In Paragraph six it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomeing confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It could be more beneficial than a teacher, because for the kids who do understand it they can move onto other things and the kids who don't can have extra help.

Most humans show facial expressions toward someone instead of verbal communication. Paragraph six Dr. Huang said that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" Most people could have a benefit to this so that they could understand the assignment they're assigned for the lab they could be doing for a science class. It just all depends on whether or not the kid would use this tool effectivly as others. It could be used as a lie detector in a way if it picks up any facial expressions.

This facial recognition can be very benefital for the kids who struggle on watching a video over how to do something. The 3-D will calculate the kids who are struggling with a problem or anything that is assigned to them. This strategy is very useful for when kids don't have any help or when the teacher is helping someone else it can help and walk the kid through the problem instead of having them get upset, because the computer can detect anything that happens to the kid while in the process of the lesson. Technology is a very useful thing for kids who struggle, become upset, or have trouble understanding.",3
0719241,"I will be writing about why you should paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will include details from the story. Also reasons to join the program. the last thing i will include is examples from the text.

My frist reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is just to experiance new things. You should not be on your phone all day doing nothing. Get up and at least try to have a little bit of fun. if you have never been there or even heard of it how do you know it is going to be boring. You never know until you drop your phone and actually join. You might end up having some fun.

A second reason is well look what Luke Bomberger did. He joined 44 nations to form unrra (the united nations relief and rehabilitation). UNRRA took care of horses, young cows, and mules that wers shipped overseas. Wouldnt you want to spend your days with nice and loving animal that wont hurt you. You never know, if no one joins Seagoing Cowboys then maybe there could have been animals who were in dangered, or might be extinct. I think that animal are really fun to hang out with.

The last and final reason is you dont just take care of animals but you help the places that were dastroyed because of world war II. It would be great if you actually got to see where many people were fighting, got killed, injured, or much more in world war II. Just like Luke in the story, you can also go to may places that he went like new orleans, or greece. This is your oppertunity to visit beautiful places that you have never been to before. You could also meet new people.

To summarize everything up those are some reasons why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. You just never know until you try it out.   ",3
071dba8,"Have you ever wondered how it would be like to travel the world? Then become a Seagoing Cowboy its invigerating to do. You travel by boat to distant lands and drop animals to those places. My crew would play games on return trips in the empty space on boats. We would play games like vollyball, baseball, table tennis Tournaments, and all sorts there. These are just some of my reasons to join now!

I also got to see alot of things on th trips I went on, nine to be exact. On a trip to China I got to see the great and Marvelous Panama canal! Venice a beatifull city with steets of water was one of my stops. These are sights some only wish on going and wouldn't imagine anyone passing that up! Thats why I'm here, to tell you to join now it changed my mind and it will change yours to. I wish you could see what I saw on my trips, its better than any picture you will ever see of it.

In my conclusion I would like to say it's not without its risks. I almost fell off the ship once but some metal caught me and I wassafe. You also attend the animals on board the ship and clean the Stalls or else it would stink bad. Other than that you have that feeling in you that you made a right choice. You would to if you joined us ,and become a Seagoing Cowboy today. You will never regret joining trust me from experience.

072c8a3,"I think that it is a neat idea to have driverless cars but only if all of the things that could go wrong have been evaluated. I can also tell you that they will never work out everything that could go wrong no matter how much they think they have. What if there is a malfunction and the car swerves and drives off of a cliff. That wouldn't be the drivers fault it would be caused by faulty technology. There would have been nothing that the driver of the vehicle could have done to prevent that from happening. What happens if one of these cars runs into another car because the technology stopped working. As stated in the passage would it be the drivers fault or the manufacturer.

You have to keep all of these things that could go wrong in mind you can't just think about the upsides of these smart cars. It would be neat to have a car drive for you i'll admit that and that is amazing that we're working on something that can do that and that we have became that technologically developed. There is just many things that need to be taken into consideration. There are so many ways someone could get hurt in something like this smart car. I think it would just be safer to not have these type of cars out and about on the street. What if they malfunctioned and ran a pedestrian over and neither the person in the car or the pedestrian walking would have seen it coming. There are already so many people being killed by drunk drivers now a days. I think achieving the development of this kind of technology would just make the death rate go up and this world doesn't need that happening it is already heart breaking how many people die in a day already.

People should not have to dread walking around if they do not have a vehicle just because they fear of this technology hitting them. They would have to take the necessary precautions in order to have this kind of technology on the streets. I don't think that the developers think of all the dangerous things that could happen by having these cars. They all just think of how cool it would be to drive a smart car. Well I can tell you that I think that to many people die from drunk drivers or people that aren't paying attention to where they are going when they are driving around. Yeah were still going to have people die from these things. We don't however need there to be more people dying because of faulty technology.

They can think that they have worked every kink out in their technology but, I can assure you that they haven't. There is always going to be a risk of something happening with this kind of technology. It's not just safe because the manufacturers say that it's safe that is just not how it works. All i'm saying is that we should be more concerned with what could go wrong than what is cool. I would rather be safe walking on a sidewalk then not wanting to leave because im scared of dying. I think that we just need to stop being lazy it's just steering a steering wheel it's not rocket science.",3
07492fd,"The use of Facial Acting Coding System would not be a practical use for the students in a class room. Many people would not want a computer looking at them to see their facial expression to determine what they like or what they dislike. Many people can often pull of a fake expression that is good enough for a computer to calculate, like in paragraph seven, which includes instructions on how to do a real smile compared to a fake smile.

Most people cover up cameras on their laptops,computers, and phones for privacy and safety. Anyone who would cover up their camera would most likely not want their face constantly being scanned to tell emotion or what they like and dislike.

In paragragh seven, the article briefly explains how to look happy, which anyone can do to fool an emotion scanner. Computers are often accurate, but only do what is coded and not anything else. If you were to always be happy but not look happy, the Facial Action Coding System would not be something useful for you or students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System can have many flaws in its design and would not be useful for students in a classroom. It may be innaccurate and not scan correctly or not be used at all for safety and privacy. there are many ways that the Facial Actions Coding System would not be useful and would not help students learn, just show how they feel about some things like websutes and ads.",3
074b43d,"Would you want to keep the Electoral College or change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States? I would want to keep the Electoral College. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, it helps people vote, and it helps people out. If i were you id pick to keep the Electoral College. So let me tell you why you should pick to keep the Electoral College.

First of all, you should pick the Electoral College because it keeps the process organized. If you didnt have the Electoral College than you'd probably be confused about a lot of things. You wouldnt know where to go to vote. Also you probably wouldnt know where the section of the electors is. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. If you didnt have the Electoral College you wouldnt know anything of that, so pick to keep the Electoral College.

Second of all, you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it helps people vote. If it wasnt for electors you probably wouldnt be picking a President or none of that because the electors set it all up. The Electoral College tells you where the meeting is to vote. The Electoral College has 538 electors and there has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect a president. So there is no reason not to pick to keep the Electoral College.

Third of all, it helps people out. It helps people out by telling them what to do, where to go, and who to vote for. If there wasnt an Electoral College it would be harder to vote. If its in the Constitution that means it will help you. The Founding Fathers put it there for a reason. So if i were you id pick the Electoral Collge i wouldnt pick to change the election by popular votes for the president of the United States.

Last but not least, I think you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, it helps people vote, and it helps people out. Why would you pick to change the election by popular votes? What good is gonna happen? Nothing. It would be better to pick to keep the Electoral College. So you should without a doubt pick the Electoral College.    ",3

They headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece which ment he could be drafted for military service. By the time Luke was discharge in 1947,Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

0760842,"Many people think or believe that they should get rid of the Electoral College vote for the president. Well in my opinion I believe they should not keep it because why do we even need them for? We have the people of the US. They can vote for a president, that's why the Constitution was written, to gives us the rights, freedom of speech, the right to vote. Why else would we have that if our vote won't really matter.

They should get rid of the Electoral College Vote because we already have many people voting for the president. We don't really need many people just to choose one man or woman to lead the country. They can just count how many citizens voted for a president and the one who has more voters is the winner. If it ends up as a tie, then just let the memebers of the House of Represenatives vote. Or at least let the popular vote decide who the president will be.

Having the Electoral College vote is useless, because they just vote for a for a slate of electors, who in turn will elect the president. It just adds more steps to elect the president. They should just get rid of it and keep the popular vote for the president of the United States. Let the qualified citizens vote who they want to be the president. It'd make more sense, because they just vote for someone who is not holding office,? anyone. I say get rid of it so that we don't get a ""disaster factor"" anymore. That 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century.? This electoral college vote is unfair , outdated, and irrational. its unfair because of the winner-take-all system.

However, many people may disagree. They belive that we should keep the electoral college vote. There's five reasons of why they think we should keep this type of method of choosing the President. The first reason is the certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to happen than a dispute over the popular vote. The second reason is everyone's president. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal and no region has enough electoral votes to elect for a president.? The third reason is the swing states. The unfair method of winner-takes-all electoral votes induces the candidates and focuses on the voters in toss-up states whom more likely pay close attention to the campaign. The fourth reason is the big states. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by letting a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. And the fifth reason is to avoid run-off elections. It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

So in conclusion they should get rid of the electoral college vote because its unfair to the small states. Knowing that their vote will not have any effect, they have no reason to pay attention to the campaign. They can just let the popular vote decide or the House of Representatives. Bob Dole was right. Lets get rid of the electoral college vote. Mostly get rid of it because its unfair to some states or people. Its is really an irrational way to settle on an agreement of who the president may be. And yes is may have less disputes over the outcome but it better to have some dispurtes over it so we elect the correct president and see what all their qualities may be. In my opinion I believe we should abolish the electoral college.    ?       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",3

Driverless cars will cause a panic. We will never be certain if the car is functioning correctly and will doubt whether we are safe or not. How can we be so sure the car will not malfuntion and crash? Thats the thing, we cant be sure and will always be doubtful of what may happen. In passage 7 it states "" But all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" By telling us this it is saying that the car is still unable to do all task that a normal human can do

Why go through all this trouble when we aleady have humans who can drive perfectly safe. We will be wasting millions and millions of pointless dollars on something that we were taught how to do. Not to mention that if the car fails there can be goverment problems from people who want to sue becuase maybe the car wasnt working corrctly

Overall This is not a smart idea. Not only will you waste millions but lose family time teachig your kid how to drive. If these haven't worked before, what makes them thing this will work this time? Technology is an amazing thing but it is taking over and its taking it over quickly. We can not let technology run our lifes.

The Electoral College might be the easiest way to contract a solid vote from American citizens, but laziness is definitely not efficient. If we want our country running smoothly and in a way that every citizen is comfortable with, everyone needs to be represented. Many citizens will start voting when they hear that they wont be pummelled with propaganda about politicians who think they know about what the people want. They will be elated to hear that they will actually be heard. They will actually make a difference in their country. The common people must be represented, not just advertisements. The conflict between upper and lower class will end because both will be able to make a difference in the minimum wages and tax increases.

Changing the election process to the popular vote would not only represent all people, but cut out the extremes. All politicians must say whether they are a Democrat or a Republican. With popular vote, we can go in depth to what the people really want. Like how gun restraints only go to an extent, so should the poeple's views. Most citizens aren't completely Republican or completely Democratic, and that's alright. There are the conditions in between that need to be addressed.

Coming from a centrally liberal family, I think that all elections through the Electoral College are hoaxes. The representatives of the College and even the president are picked a long time beforehand. The government wants to brainwash the citizens to slowly turn us onto their side. Even if the government rigs the votes but says that the result is completely dependant on the people, it will still belate citizens and get them to participate more in the voting process.    ",3
077377d,"The Electoral College is a process,?not a place. The meaning of Electoral College is stated in Source 1: What is Electoral College and in paragraph 2.??The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the countiing of the electoral votes by congress. It consist of 538 electors. a majority of 270 eletoral votes is required to elect the president. The electoral College is very?important because it helps us decide who the new president of the United States is going to be, but alot of people thimk that it is unfair and should be abolished.

To begin with, Electoral College is unfair because voters do not vote for the president they vote for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president. The?electors can be anyone not holding public office. The elector are picked by the state. Sometimes the voters cannot pick who the electors vote for. ?""The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It is hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College.

But,?in defense of the Electoral College, there are a few?reasons to keep our disliked method of choosing the president. One reasons is the Elecotoral College requires a prestidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. Also to avoid the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the vote cast. Lastly the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states.

Inconclusion, the Electoral College can be a good way to vote, but also it can be a bad way to vote.    ",3

A seagoing cowboy is someone who takes care of animals that are shipped over sea. Then brings them to the people that need help since the war ruined their food supply or cattle.

It is kinda hard to care for the animals but its not to much of a challenge. I used to help out on my aunts farm all the time and that gave me some experience. It also is a little disgusting to clean the stalls the first time but I pulled through it and eventually I got used to it. My favorite part has to be traveling when i get some free time its fun to go sight seeing.

As a seagoing cowboy you go all around the world and visit amazing places but there are sad moments aswell. When I found out that people other than me are being affected by the war and some are suffering worse, that opened up my eyes. I thought to myself thats why I joined the seagoing cowboys after all not just because I wanted to see the world but also to help people in need.

Lastly being a seagoing cowboy isnt just an adventure its much more. Its part of our future. We need to help everyone in the world through this hard time. Being a seagoing cowboy will help do that. Please consider the offer and sign up.                      ",3
077acd9,"Do you think that there are advantages to limiting car usage? Yes, I do think that there are advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution. There are many advantages of having limited car usage. This includes many different transportations and because of car culture.

To begin with, there are advantages to limited car usage because of pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog, the smog rivale Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gas. Diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines. Paris has more smog than other European capitals.

To continue, there are advantages to limited car usage because of many different acts of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia a program is set to spread to other countries. It was called a ""Car Free"" day which meant that you could not use your car for a whole day. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the? streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

Furthermore, there are advantages to limited car usage because of Car Culture. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions is to shift in American behavior. Research studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The United States has long been one of the world's prime car cultures. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" says Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation

Research Institute. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.

In conclusion, there are many different advantages to limiting car usage because of pollution, many different acts of transportation, and because of Car Culture.       ????    ",3

078f997,"Many people and other scientists believe that the Face was created by aliens. But, I definitely disagree. First, the Face may be shaped like an actual human being's face, but it's not an actual human being face. Clearly, there's sufficient evidence to prove the Face was not created by aliens. For example, there aren't any alien monuments, and there aren't any aliens! Pictures were taken ten times, to make sure that we got clear vision of the face. Even when picture of the Face appeared on the JPL web site, some people and other scientists, thought the Face looked like a natural landform. That's because a a shadow figure kind of looks like a human face, that doesn't mean it's an actual human. Also, never have I ever seen an alien. Contrary to popular opinion, aliens don't even exist. That's almost saying the aliens are going to take over the world.

Then, I have never heard of aliens creating the Face, knowing aliens creating anything else.

The face is a natural landform because it's just a shadow. Before, when Nasa's viking ship took pictures of the shadow, their camera could have had a bad angle and probably tried to make the shadow look like a real human face.

Next, never have I have heard of a viking ship capturing pictures of any aliens. Or, have I never of anyone capturing pictures of any aliens creating the Face.

In conclusion, I still think that the Face is a human landform because, once again, there aren't any aliens. Also, there aren't any alien monuments. I think everybody is just exageratting about the whole thing. Also, people could just be freaked out about what they had heard. Some could agree with me, or some couldn't.

Driverless cars would be much easier for drivers in many ways. Drivers would not have to steer, accelertate, or brake their car, the car would do all of those things on its own. The driver would not have to do any work, unless the car notify the driver when the road requires human skills.

Having an driverless car would create an fun or more enjoyable time while driving. Even though the driver would stil have to watch the road, the driver would enjoy being able to relax in the car without having to drive.

The driver would not get bored, and would be often entertained because, the car would have in-car entertainment and information system. The in-car entertainment and information systems would also be safe because it would use heads-up displays that would turn off when the driver needs to take over.

By having an driverless car, you would not have to spend as much money on fuel because the car would only use half the fuel of todays taxis. I think that is a big improvement because you would not have to worry about having gas because it would not use as much. Also since the car offers more flexibility, you would be able to have more room, and do more things.

079e8bb,"You're living the high life. You have a Driverless Car. What could go wrong? A lot can go wrong. Technology is a grand thing, but it's also a power. If we let it keep accumulating like this we could be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We can't let technology over rule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless cars. Soon cars will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In todays world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let cars start driving themselves we could get laszy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless cars on the rise this could get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the car didn't do what it was suppose to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of qestions and concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This is good. Their are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most cases. They know how to take control.

The practice of driveless cars are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They care about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are cars that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car is a smart car. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assitance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to rememeber who exactly is in charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore. We will be living in technologies world; not the world we worked so hard to build. This is why we need not let driveless cars come in to existance.           ",3

07ce28e,"In the age of technology, we are constantly searching for better ways to communiucate to computers. It seems as though they are just blocks of plastic, wiring, and metal that have no empathy, brains, or hearts. But what if computers could understand human emotion? The computer could know what we are feeling and give us results to match that mood. This is becoming a reality for society today, as a new software, the Facial Action Coding System has promising results for understanding and catergorizing human emotions. This technology could be used in the classroom, where it would provide a better learning environment for students if the computer could understand the students and know if they were bored or tired, and would adjust its program accordingly.

The Facial Action Coding System was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illnois and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. The FACS first costructs a 3-D model of the face with all 44 face muscles. Movement of one or muscles is called an action unit. Dr. Paul Eckman, another creator of FACS, has ""classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated them with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles."" The FACS was tested on the Mona Lisa, and detected her as ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" A computer being able to understand human emotion would be groundbreaking, as ""most human communication is nonverbal, including, emotional communication."" We as humans have a variety of expressions, from huge ones to very subtle changes in mood. Computers need to understand these, along with the subtle facial movements that go with them. A extensive calculation is needed in order to acheive this goal. We humans perform this 'calculation' every day, as we can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face by taking their facial cues into consideration of their emotion. A comptuter that could a similar thing as such would know when you're happy or sad, and then react accordingly. If you were to smile at a Web ad, it would send a similar one. But if you frowned, the next one would be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Hunag predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for a better learning environment and teaching skills for students.

The use of this technology would be outstanding and unbelievably helpful in the classroom. It could accurately identify a student's emotions and change the lesson plan to meet their own academic needs. This technology not only can identify emotions, but can help humans to react to them. With more expressive characters in video games and movies, humans can identify and repilcate such emotions, as we have empathy. Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions, and computers with the FACS software could allow for that and much more to occur. Technology as we know it today could be changed forever. If computers do acquire the FACS software, then it would be able to identify human emotions and adjust accordingly.",3
07d6f42,"Technology has been vastly improving these past couple of years. With all these new technological improvements it can also play a major factor in classrooms. All teenagers these days are very ""tech-friendly"". Therefore it would only make sense that we should incorporate some of these technological adavances

into the classroom so students could be more engaged during class. It would greatly improve many homework scores, quiz scores, and even test scores

thus overall having many improvements to their grades in all.

The new software "" Facial Action Coding System"" has been a huge technological improvement to this time.

In the passage it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements---in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotion."" This can show how in a classroom if students are being active during a lesson and participating. Or if they are dozing off somewhere else with the help of this technology then the computer can change its algorithms to change how the lesson is being taught therefore making the student pay attention during class.

In a classroom filled with some kids that just can't focus and/or do not understand then this technology can come into great use. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" the passage states. This technology could help students that have trouble with some classes or just are not paying attention whatsoever, in the passages it also states,

""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With this technology it can highly improve on keeping the students attention at all times, this can help the students with making sure they know whats going on during class at all times instead of zoning out then missing something very cruical and overall messing alot of things up but instead keeping them highly engaged at all times.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is greatly valuable. The use of this technological advancement would greatly improve students comprehension of some classes in school that they might've not understood before. It would be more personalized to that specific person, the more confused you look the more different ways it would look to make sure you understand the concept. Thus making the student very proactive and improving their overall grade. ",3
07e11fc,"The Face on Mars

There is a great population of people who believe aliens exist and cause strange things to happen and space crafts to appear. Many people know that it is just science fiction and that there is no evidence showing that aliens actually exist. This has been going on for decades and the believers need to face the truth. They can belive as long as they want, but there is no evidence.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform. Meteors and other space rocks strike the planets, and even the moon. Those can be a possible cause of the Face on Mars. With astronauts exploring Mars to see if it is capable of supporting life, the Face could be caused by the humans collecting large amounts of the planet and walking all over it. Aliens are nothing but a fictional character in the many Hollywood movies.

As humans with the sense of sight, we are used to seeing faces on a daily basis. We look at clouds and depict them as something we have seen before. Or a tree that looks like a face was made out of it's bark. It is understandable that you could see a face on Mars because that is human imagination. The Face is just a natural effect of what caused it to happen. Sure, we might not know about everything that goes on in space, but we do know that many people are interested in the fact that Mars may be able to suport life.

Scientist are doing everything they can to know more than enough about Mars. They have rovers and cameras to look at Mars from Earth and be able to study it without traveling all the way there. There are many photos and videos of Mars and what you might see there, but no aliens were found. Their equipment is high quality and no blurs or scratches could be seen as something it's not.

For those who support the belief that aliens roam Mars, they can invest on the discovery, but find it wasteful. The Face is just a landform and you would need evidence to support your alien claim. There are many photos that were taken over time of the Face and the differences could be because of erosion or asteroids. Many things go on in space, but alien activity isn't one of them.  ",3
07e4b76,"Do you think that the ""Face on Mars"" is not a real face but just a natural landform? Well, we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, it rereal that it's just a natural landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were. In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West.

First of all, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surefers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing that it's just a natural landform.

Next, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. ""So, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!""

On the other hand, some people might say that the Mars Orbiter Camera team didn't take the photo cleary than the original Viking photos or they could think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars but, on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" said Garvin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Last, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landforms common aroung the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, we think that the ""Face on Mars"" is not a real face but just a natural landform because we think it is just a naural landform because when the first image appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural

landform. Also, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground you would be able to see what they were.

07e96aa,"The Face on Mars was a mysterious topic for several years. The Face was believed to be an alien monument. However, through research, NASA was able to confirm that the Face is in fact not an alien monument, but instead a natural landform on the surface of mars.

This famous picture has gotten a lot of attention in the media. What some people may not realize is that the photograph was taken through clouds. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" Some believed alien markings were hidden by the haze, but perhaps the haze was instead covering up detail in the landform that would show that it is not a face, nor an alien monument, but instead just a natural landform. NASA also happened to have technology that could clear up this picture. The technology used to explain this photograph was described by stating, ""You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This shows that NASA has the technology needed to explain this image. After using this technology, the image was revealed. The text claims that the photograph shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. It is also said in the passage that these are common lanforms in the American West. It is clear that this landform is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, and it certainly is no alien monument.

There a many reasons that make it seem like the land form could have been made by aliens, but on the other hand there was no signs of any living thing that could have done this. there are many thing with this object that could lead you to beliveing either it was made by aliens.

In 1976 the Vikking took the picture that was bellived to look like a face. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over mars snapping pictuers that were ten times sharper than the first picture of then the first picture taken. By increaseing the sharpness of the picture it showed that it was a land form. The time of year that the first picture was taken it was a cloudy over the Red Planet. This could have made shadow that made the form look like it had eyes and nosie.

The last time the picture was taken (2001) the picture was taken in maximum resolution. This maximum photo if taken of earth you could see the pirimds in Egypt. So if there was anything weird the picture would have shown it.

In conclusion the picture taken in 2001 '' actually shows is the Martin eqivalent of a butte or mesa----landforms common around the American West.''(paragraph 12). All signs are now pointing to the fact that it was a natural landform. In the end NASA found out what it really was and that alines making this figure was false.",3

I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional . But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things .We dont need computer to see people emotional we can tell by the way a person talk . If that person sound like he or she got a additon (come back) that mean that person is in a bad mood and don't want to talk at that time .

Does computer even have emotional?

I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal . Compuer don't know what true happence or sadness mean they just tell us whatever they programer put inside them. True happness is something you don't feel its just there . Sadness is somthing thats doesn't feel good something that hurts on the inside.

This will help students who struggle to understand some class material. The computer can, based on the students emotion, change the way the material is seen, heard, and understood. If a computer can read the emotions of someone who is trying to study, it can alter the way the person studies to make it easier and more enjoyable.

Some may argue that using this technology isn't fair to the students. That students emotions shouldn't be read by a computer. That to understandable. However, some students are afraid to ask for help because they don't want to be precieved as dumb or unintelligent. With this system, the students emotions will be confidentually read and then used to help the student. Because it can help struggling students, students who have difficults studying, and students who are afraid to voice their confusion, using the Facial Actions Coding System is a valuable tool in classroom..",3
081db56,"I think that the new technology, FACS

which stands for facial action coding system is valuable. Because knowing how others are feeling can help develop stronger relationships and bonds with friends and family. And can also help a person console another person if they are feeling sad, lonely, and angry, even if the other person doesn't show their true emotions/ feelings.

And the technology FACS

can recognize different human emotions such as sadness or happiness even if the person's face doesn't have any emotion or expressions on it.

And we could also learn more on how our emotions change from time to time and why they change.

And could help develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

And it would help people that have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, and other emotions like that.

And it may help with teaching students. Like, say if a person is bored they probably won't learn as much as someone who isn't bored. Or that if someone is confused they don't really learn anything and it doesn't really help them focus either. But someone who isn't confused or isn't bored will likely learn better than those who are confused or bored.

If it is something that the student likes or is intersted it they will likely listen and probably won't be confused nor bored. But if it is something that they don't really like or it isn't interesting to them then they may not pay attention to it and may get bored and/or get confused.

And may help people learn and grow well.

And also if the person learning doesn't really like the lesson or is not interested or is bored or confused then the computer can change the lesson to something that the student will probably like and not be bored or confused with anything on or in the lesson. Or the computer can suggest something else or another lesson for the student to do to see if they do better in the lesson and enjoy it more and focus more.

It can improve education and how well students know everything and can encourage good attitudes and positive things in the present and the future.

Also, it can help encourage people to talk more often and make friends and to also encourage people to help others and things like that.

And maybe advise teachers in a way to make the lesson their teaching more enjoyable and helpful by playing games or letting students have a group of partners to help them and such.

And may help students have better grades/ do better in school and maybe even do better in extra- curricular activities such as sports.

And help student focus on the things they need to do. And help the teachers to make lessons where it will help the students learn better and be more fun for them.

May also inspire people to work harder or more and do different things and come up with new or different ideas and such. And may even motivate the person to do something that they want to do or accomplish.

Possibly even to pursue goals and/ or dreams . And technology can help us with a lot of different things like understanding how things work and other things like that. ",3
08207e4,"Driverless cars shouldnt be aloud. theyare dangerious, they could increse the rate for teens, increase the rate for death during a car crash, and what if the senor broke on the side of the car you wouldnt even know so you could just fly off the road.

Having a driveless care shouldnt be aloud at all. first they could increase the the rate for czr crashes in teens. the rate is already high for them expecially in Indiana and we dont even have them kind of cars yet. Cell phones are a major role to the youth in todays time. that is the main reason for so many recks today so if you give them a car that can drive its self, they are not gone do nothing but text and not pay attention to the rode at all basically if you was to do that you are setting them up fro their own death.

Second ,by not creating these kinds of car and giving them out you could be saving your company alot of money. Because if somebody was to get in a reck and they wasnt driving but the car was driving its self they gone come to the people who made the car because they feel like it was thier fault. Even tho you told them that they still had to pay attention to the rode they not cuz they feel like the car can watch its self. so if you dont put the car on the market you can save your company alont of money and alot of stress.

Third, you wouldnt wanna be the reason for any deaths, because if you start getting so many deaths on your car nobody is going to want your car so now you then wasted money on all these cars and parts for these cars that nobody is buying so you just lost alot of money and nobobody just has money to waste. If your company starts to lose money they gone have to start cutting people because they can no longer pay you, and the first person they are going to fire are the people who came up with the idea that caused them to lose so much money in conslusion i think t would be your best bet to just not make the cars because your saving money, your saving lives so now your heros, and you dont have to worry about anybody tryong to sue you for most of everything yall got because if the person win boy yall feelings gone be hurt ",3
0821b94,"The world of automotive technology is constanly changing for what engineers believe is the best for society. There are always new and improved ideas for cars, but some of them may not be in the best interest for people. The idea of a car that drives itself seems both unreliable and unrealistic. After reading this passage the idea of a self-driving car seems like more of a hassle than the number one item on a person's Christmas list.

The ""driverless"" cars of today are far from not needing drivers. Most cars, like the Toyota Prius, have many sensors within the car. Though these sensors do help alert the driver if the car is out of control, they do not fix the siuation or get themselves out of it. I have been in a Toyota Prius on a dangerous, icey road, and the car did alert the driver when we were out of control, but the car did not correct the situation it rather made a loud beeping noise and had a flashing signal on the dash. These cars are not driving themselves, but instead relying on the drivers to pay attention to their warnings.

Self-driving cars are also a problem when it comes to legal situations. Dr. Werner Huber believes that entertainment while driving is a great idea for drivers who still need to pay attention to the road. So what happens when a driver is distracted and does not adhere to their self-driving car's warnings? Well the same probelm that occurs with drivers every day. There will still be wrecks and deaths. These cars are not making the roads a safer place, but instead making legal situations more confusing by not knowing who is at fault for an accident.

Though these cars have no large, positive effect on society engineers still continue to work every day on them. These cars are not changing what the base of a car is, but are getting plenty of attention for it. Self-driven cars are unachievable, and they do not benefit society in a positive way.",3
08629e7,"The use of this technology to ready the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Why? to me this idea has some pros and cons. In the case of the Mona Lisa it seems a lot more reasonalbe to use this type of technology because in reality if we just look at the painting we dont know what her emotions are but since whis new Facial Action Coding System came out it'd be a lot more usefull on her than in students in a classroom.

Now these days students don't have a lot of excitment to come to school and are often distracted with the other things going on around them. If you have the Facial Action Coding System have them identify their emotions they will pay even less more attention in class. Wether or not a student isn't as excited to do math homework is the FACS gonna be able to change the students way of feeling towards the homework? Will the students way of feeling about homework change by a computer system? I honestly dont think it'd be a good idea to have that kind of system in a classroom.

In my opinion the idea of having it in a classroom is a bad idea. This system may work on other things but not in a classroom with students. This system can also fail. If a student is happy but just has a serious face the sysytem is going to go by what the student looks like not the way he/she actually feels inside.

Technology now a days is taking over everything, this FACS

will just make people much lazier because they know that instead of asking the way they feel they'll just want to use the system because its much faster and easier instead of going up to the person and actually asking how they feel. It'll create less comunication with one another.

The Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to me a useful technology system for students in a classroom.",3

0870f09,"Changing the election by popluar vote for the President of the United States would be a better option than keeping the Electoral College. Although they have a meeting where they are voting for President and Vice President, doesn't the citizens of United States do the same thing. Since we help choose our states electors when we vote for which President we want, why can't our vote be the last vote to count?

Qualified citizens of the United States should have the final say so on who we want our President to be. We choose our President based off of what they said they will do to make the USA a better place. Instead of the citizens voting for a state elector we should vote for who we want President. Since we will be living in the type of envoriment they set.

The Electoral College is unfair to votes because of the winner take all system they have in each state. And if the Electoral College can't decide or have a tie , the election would be thrown to the House of Represetatives where? they vote on the President. What about what the citizen of the United States want our President to be?

Since the state legislatures are tehnically repsonible for picking the electors , those electors could always defy the will of the people. So leaving the vote up the elecotor is another reason why we should not keep the Electoral College. Citizens that vote can not control who the electors vote for. The electors can even get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. Or even take the advantage of thier own to vote for who they think is right, rather who the citizens wanted them to vote for.       ????    ",3
001ab80,"People always wish they had the same technology that they have seen in movies, or the best new piece of technology that is all over social media. However, nobody seems to think of the risks that these kinds of new technologies may have. Cars have been around for many decades, and now manufacturers are starting to get on the bandwagon and come up with the new and improved technology that they hope will appeal to everyone. As of right now, it seems as though the negative characteristics of these cars consume the positive idea that these manufacturers have tried to convey.

Currently, this new technology in cars has a very long way to go before being completely ""driverless"". Drivers still need to be on alert when they are driving, as well as control the car near any accidents or complicated traffic situations. This seems to totally defeat the purpose of the ""driverless"" car. Eventually the technology may improve, but nobody can be certain that the driverless car will eventually become completely ""driverless"". This idea just seems like a lot of hard work and money for something that is not very neccessary. If someone does not want to drive their car they can just take a city bus or a subway. There are so many options of transportation that can already solve this problem. Even if masnufacturers are trying to make driving more ""fun"", driving is not meant to be ""fun"" it is meant to get people where they need to go. Playing around in a car just to have ""fun"" is just a recipe for disaster.

The idea of the driverless car also raises many questions about who will be liable when someone gets into an accident in one of these new cars. Many states do not even let people drive semi-automatic cars because there are not even laws that pertain to the liability of anyone who get into an accident while driving these type of cars. If these cars become more popular, states may pass new laws. However, this topic also raises questions about who is able to dictate whether or not it was the car or the human's fault for an accident. Since this technology is so new, there could be many problems with the car's system that nobody has even discovered since they have not drove the car themselves. If someone test drives this kind of car or even purchases one and they get into a crash not knowing what could possibly happen to them, they will want to sue the car manufacturer since they were not aware of any bugs in the car's system. These lawsuits can add up and eventually the manufactuers will be in a bunch of debt, which could cost them their whole idea of the driverless car.

The technology car manufacturers are trying to develope may just be a diasaster in the making. There are many alternative options of transportations if you do not feel like driving yourself, and these options are way less expensive than buying a brand new car. Although this technology is relatively new, we can not be certain that this new idea will even pay off in the end, it may just be a waste of money and time. Sometimes the newest technology is not the most benefical.         ",4
001bdc0,"We all heard about Venus, the planet without almost oxygen with earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit but what if scientist project the futur into this planet ? Through this article, the author uses evidences appealing to reason and concession to make us realize why we should care about studying this planet so that people must give a chance to Venus.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size but has a really different climate. As it is evoked by the author:

( 3) ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus¨s atmosphere. On the planet¨s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit....Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" The author uses of concession tell us what is the actual climate of Venus. He tell us the truth, he support the fact that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit but he also recognize that there's a danger present continuously. And because he support the idea of studying Venus, he proposes ways to study the planet and find a solution at a reasonable distance.

Venus is an inhospitable planet that can almost be considered as an impossible dwelling for humans. But for the author, that can't keep scientist to do their job (studying Venus) : (5) ""NASA¨s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Through this evidence, appealing to reasonning, the author talk about the NASA's possible solution to raise his credibility. But also, to convince the audience that we can only find a solution by studying the planet.

In conclusion, despite of Venus hostility put in advance by the concession, the author makes the audience realize that there's a solution but that we can find it only if we study the planet. He make us find out that challenge and curiosity is part of human life. But also that danger and fear should not stop us from discovering new things. After all, we are Humans.",4
0030e86,"If I were to choose between keeping the electoral college or abolishing it, I would chose for abolishing it. The electoral college has a system that can be considered confusing to most americans. This system indirectly transfers citizen's votes to congress. This allows for loopholes and sabaotage to be commited during the process of electing a president.

I propose abolishing the electoral college and replacing it with a simpler system that appeals to all united states citizens instead of just certain citizens. Based on phrases in the passage, there is evidence that the electoral college system is corrupt. An example would be:

Back in 1960. segregationalists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in relpacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

-source 2, second paragraph.

This is stating that in 1960 people who opposed Kennedy nearly became his electors. So if they succeeded in becoming his electors his votes would have gone to another opposing candidate. This could not happen with a system of voting that directly conected everyones votes with congress. This was a clear case of sabotage in the election of 1960.

Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states. In reality it is limiting the votes of citizens. If people ignored how larger states had more people than smaller states and just thought of everyone as individuals everyone would have a say. The system I am proposing does not view states as the voters, but every american citizen as one. After everyone passed their votes, they would all be tallied and which ever candidate had the most votes would win.

You may think that the votes could be sabotaged, and that politicians could put in fake votes and get rid of real ones. This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped.

I propose this system to ensure that every citizen has a vote, and that corruption while transitioning the votes would be eliminated. This would be a less confusing system that could make voting more efficient.       ?    ",4
005a72e,"I agree that driverless cars are a developing idea. I do like the fact that these cars should be used by the public. They could lead us to a whole other revolutionary idea with the way the human race lives our lives. It could help us all out with our neccessaties. Also it could help us with other sciences in our lives such as medical assisstants and drivers. Next, the ability to drive without a driver could help us alll in the aspect of the way on how we live our lives.

First, for example in the text paragraph 7 it says how the company of BMW has made the ""Trafiic Jam Assisstant"" which could help us drive up to 25 mph without the need to do anything at all. Driverless cars dont just help us at drving it helps us at being smarter. The science put into these cars to drive without any work is fascinating. If we could put that same science in other fields justy as medical, then the possibilites are endless. We could have assisstant doctors getting us tools that we need,when we need them, and alarming us when something is wrong.

Next, these cars are fantastic for elderly people who are unable to drive by themselves. They offer a sugnificant amount of assisstants for them so they dont have to rely on anyone else. Next, it could help keep us safe in our cars. For example, in the article in paragraph 7 it also states that these new cars have developed a drivers seat that ""vibrates"" when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. These cars can reduce the amount of vehicle incidents very much. Not only can they stop us from backing in to something but they can also stop us from being killed.

After that, they have video cameras also in every corner of the car to help the driver sense any danger around them. For Instance, in parapraph 4 they tell of how they have a ""spinning sensor on the roof that uses laser beams to form a constantly updated 3-d model of the car and it's surrounding. They need all of these so it could act as if a human being was in the driver's seat. Further more, these ""newer cars"" dont just give us new abilities, but also the new knowledge. They show us what needs improvement and what doesn't. Also, they help us guide our way to safety if we are lost.

To inculde, these cars could also lead us to anywhere we need. This is very important in case someone gets lost. For example, if someone is lost on a camping trip and is in the wrong spot there and needs assisstance, then there car could lead then to safety and tell them exactly where they are located. It could also serve as a discovery unit. For instance, if someone is in a new town or city then they need to know where the gas station, hotel, restaurant, etc are and there car would take them there. They would help them navigate to whereever there destination might be.

In conclusion, the need for cars that do not need a driver is very important to our everyday lives. They would help navigate, save, and make our lives easier. They would help our economy out tremendoulsy by reducing accidents and the death rate. Next, they would help with people who need it such as elderly and disabled people. Last, these cars are getting closer and closer to becoming a part of our daily lives already, because we have the science that helped us develop these types of cars now.",4

The problem with today's world is our lives revovle around cars to get us where we want to be and they have become a status symbol for many.? The thought of being without a car scares most people, but limiting car usage is becoming more popular in cities, and has shown many advantages in the enviorment and in the communities.? For example, the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars compltely (Rosenthal).? On the otherhand, Paris, France banded driving due to smog-only odd license plates could drive one day and even numbered plates could drive the next day (Duffer).? Many advantages came with limiting driving in these cities such as, less air poplution from tailpipes, congestion lessened, and indroduced alternative ways of transportaion into differnet communities.

""Passenger cars are 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States"" (Rosenthal).? This means if car usauge was limited than we could cut back on almost 50 percent of our polution in the United States.? ""Transportation is the second largest source for America's emissions"" (Rosenthal).? The limiting of car usage would also help and knock down cars as being the second biggest emissions source in the U.S.? Without so much air polution in the United States we could live healthier and better lives.? We would be able to ruduce global warmimg if we reduce the amount of driving we do.

Another advantage with limiting car usage would be the decrease in congestion around our city and towns.? ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" (Duffer). This means that traffic would die down as well, there would be no more rush hour after work, and the roads would be safer because there would be less people driving on them.

Lastly, limiting car usage would bring people to find alternative and healthier ways to get to where they need to be.? In Bogota, Colombia every year for one day millions of people bike, skateboard, or take public transport to get where they want to be (Selsky).? With people using alternative ways to get to work it would not only? benefit the enviorment as well as benefiting their health.

The answer is clear, we need to limit the usage of cars in America.? Other countries are doing it and now is our time to jump on board with the movement of less car movement.? So the next time you get in the car and buckle your seatbelt think about the advantages that could come from not driving today.    ?    ",4
0084f6c,"What exactly is the facial action coding system? Well it enables computers to identify human emotions and expressions. This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.

The worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it stated that ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc."" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.

Facial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor."" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.

By being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.

In the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.                                                   ",4
0098ef4,"Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.

In the article, 'Car-Free Cities' it talks a lot about the advantanges of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage ""Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occaional distant motor."" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says ""Passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usages, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life."" Moreover, in the passage it also says ""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" Furthermore, ""In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway."" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.

By limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Moreover, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicylce paths."" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;"" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.    ",4

Speaking of emotions, the Facial Action Coding System would be able to prevent students from getting too angry or too stressed. If a student is showing strong negative emotions, the FACS could notify someone or tell the student to take a break.

Many students hide their negative emotions in a classroom, for fear of looking bad amongst their peers. The FACS could help students, by acknowleding their emotions and change the lesson or the atmosphere. Overall this could boost both grades and school attendence, by making students feel valued, like someone cares about their feelings.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in schools could be a valuable asset to education. It could help students improve, keep them from getting too upset, and make them feel valued.   ",4
00a6693,"Do you ever have a yearning to have an experience where you help people, and see new places? I had one of those eye-opening trips myself when I took part in being a Seagoing Cowboy. All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.

When having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.

On these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.

People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.

Becuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",4
00b2fe2,"I think the idea of ""driverless""'cars might not actually be such a bad idea. I mean what could be any better? A car you get into and it will take you wherever you desire? Driverless cars could have less accidents, save gas, and maybe even get people where they need to be quicker.

Theoretically thinking, a driverless vehicle could potentially cause a lot less trouble than a vehicle with a human driver. Sometimes, humans don't tend to make the best choices ever. Every year many people die because of drunk drivers alone. Many people also die just because some idiot decided they didn't need to pay attention, that text was just too important or than phone call may have been too important. More important than someones life of course. With driverless cars they would not have to worry about any of that, as long as they knew where they were going the car would get them there and back safely.

What's even better than a car you don't have to worry about driving? A car you don't have to worry about driving, while saving gas. According to the text, Mr Sergey Brin forsees cars that would use half the fuel that taxis use in todays world. Even if it wasnt much, if you add up everyone that rides taxis it accumulates and eventually everyones contributing to the problem. So a car that could use only half of the gas we use today, like is there any reason to say no to these cars?

Many people almost never get anywhere on time, some may have too much going on some might just not care. Whatever the case may be, what if these driverless cars could get you wherever you needed to be in the quickest way possible while not breaking the law. The driverless car could get you where you need to get by taking the quickest route possible. With all the advanced technology being promised the car could know whats ahead of it and if it will slow your trip down. For example if the car knows that up ahead is construction zone where you would have to slow down and waste time, it could just take a more efficient way and eventually save you time.

Driverless cars, hopefully soon, will no longer be a thing of the past. With technology just advancing without stopping i think soon driverless cars would just be another normal vehicle you see on the road. To me driverless cars would be an astounding idea. ",4
00b3311,"Did you know that Venus was maybe once like earth? And also maybe know that ""Mechanical Computers"" were used back in World War II that NASA may get ther idea for a invention to study Venus ? Sounds shocking right, well let me tell how and why these two questions may sound odd, but intresting.

NASA has been working on finding ways to study Venus. They have simplified electronicsthat are made of ""silicon carbide"" that have been tested in a chamber that is like Venus's surface, and has lasted for about 3 weeks in the comditons as Venus's surface. They still are working on other inventions that will allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully knowledge of Venus. NASA has also wanted a ship to orbit and hover safely far above the planet so that it can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of photography and videography of Venus. Astronomers have wanted to return to Venus but they wasnt a mission safe and scientifically productive. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believe in the solar sytem long ago Venus was like was just like Earth at one point. They also believe that Venus once had the features like eath like an ocean, mountains, valleys, and craters. In Venusian geology and weather present erupting volcanoes and frquent lighting , and maybe even strikes on the land surfaces. Venus atomosphere is about 97 percent of carbon dioxide and has a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Its temaptures are an average over 800 degrees , its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather that we experience on our own planet. Each pervious mission was unmanned and maybe thats a good reason no spacecraft survived the landing, or ecplains why not a single spaceship hs touched down on Venus in more than three decases. And is why Astonomers have also wanted a safe mission to go to Venus. And it is also why its a challenging planet for humans to study,which is like is said before why NASA has been wantiing to find good ways to study Venus. Another project taking us back to old technology us ""Mechanical Computers"". These computures were used in World War II,and these devices were used to make calculations andby using gears and levers and it did not require elctronic at al. Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicate when it came to physical conditons. systens that use nechanical parts can be made mire resistabt to pressure, heat a and other forces.

So Venus is a worthy, despite of the dangers and earth abd beyind should not be limited by daners abd doubts because uou shoild be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginatio and innovation. Meeting the challenge to study Venus has value but not because its interesting but because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimitdating endevaours.                        ",4
00c3589,"Exploration is key to a humans curiosity.Many people will indeed be anxious to explore something that is said to be impossible or dangerous because of curiosity.""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a prime example. In this article the author states different reasons why it is worth stuying Venus depite the extreme dangers it brings.

One reason why the author of this article supports his ideas well is because he used statistics or in other words he used pathos.In paragraph five, he said""...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""He mentioned the idea of NASA creating a ""blimp-like"" vehicle to fly over the Venusian landscape.Then he went on and entered his counterclaim by saying""...far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground condition...,""therefore Venus would only be visible but not accesible and NASA would not be able to take samples of the planet.

Secondly,he states some facts about Venus itself.He added that ""...Venus is the closests planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""This is a good fact to add in to give the idea as to why NASA would choose to attempt studying Venus.Also he siad that""...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""This gives the idea that the study of Venus has already been attempted before and has unfortunately failed every single time.

Last but not least,in his conclusion he built a strong conclusion by mentionding in his opinion that""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginataion and innovation."" This can be used for both life and NASA continuing on trying and trying until they succesfully study Venus.

In conclusion, the author supported his ideas well in the article. He supported his idead with statistics from NASA theirselves and he gave facts about Venus. He also included his counterclaims. Over all he gave a well informend and structures article.   ",4
00ccc2d,"Space travel is something we people of Earth have just only begun to tinker with. Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

The planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater..."" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author stated that ""Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Shortly after this, they also stated that ""Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.

The author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors."" They also say in the next sentence ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.

The exploration of Venus is indeed a difficult and dangerous task, but in the end would be worth while. By advancing our technologies we can bypass the dangers of Venus and pave the road to move onto even more dangerous and difficult tasks, both on out planet and outside our planet. We could gain the knowledge of how similar Earth and Venus are, finalizing if it could have or did support life at one point in time. And the factors making Venus so dangerous, would be minimalized and surpassed. ",4
00d4911,"To the senator of florida,

I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president (according to source 3), there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.    ",4
00e047b,"A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.

The smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)

Vauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is "" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (source 3)

In 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars. (source 1)

Limiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.       ?    ",4
00eabc5,"Just Straight FACS

Anybody can read a room. Whether it's at a party, an important meeting, a funeral, or a Pre-Calculus lesson at 8 a.m., it's easy to look around and see how the people around you are feeling due to body language and facial expression.

Others don't think so, though. Prof. Thomas Huang and his team of experts have come up with new tech that can recognize all 44 muscles in the human face, and create a diagnostic on how a person is feeling. This is interesting, yes, but some may think that this technology could be used in classrooms to get a general feel on what each student is feeling about a lesson.

I believe that using the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in a classroom setting would have no merit and would just be a waste of time and money in public schools across America, because of how weak the technology in the FACS actually is.

In the text, Dr. Huang says that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" and that ""varying degrees of expression"" can still be used to recognize the feelings and emotions of any human being. When applying this to a classroom enviroment, this can't be correct. That is due to many natural factors in humans.

For example, the world has progressed a lot, and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed to be involved in regular classes. For a student with a form of autism, it may be hard for them to convey certain emotions on a regular basis. The technology wouldn't be able to read their face correctly. Another example is for a student with a physical disability whose face couldn't be read properly by the FACS. There are too many outliers for the technology to be accurate, unless you had a room of children who all express their emotions like an open book.

The text also says that ""most human communications are nonverbal."" I agree with this statement, actually. It proves that one can never tell what a person is thinking just by what they say, or their facial expressions. The only true place you can know how somebody really feels is in their mind. I, for one, never really say or express how I feel about school infront of any sort of teacher or staff. It's a general rule among students at my school to onlt talk about teachers or lessons outside of the classroom. Now, this may not be how it is in other public school settings. If it happened to, though, then the FACS technology would be obsolete in its purpose.

Lastly, in paragraph 9, the text says that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""putting on a face"", or a poker face, actually trains your body to be in a better mood. This means that literally anyone could trick the FACS into thinking that they were in a happy mood when need be. Students could easily ""beat the system"" by manipulating the FACS into giving off a false diagnostic every time, and therefore ruining the FACS's credability. Until the FACS can tell when a group of teenagers are faking their emotions, it can't perform its main task.

In conclusion, Dr.Huang's FACS technology cannot work due to how baseless it's ethics are, how difficult it really is to understand emtions just by facial expression, and how easy it is to manipulate it's process.",4

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

In the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.

A second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.

Throughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",4
013ac83,"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governements, and are? acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advavtages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Cars are defined as a motor vecheil that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas.? acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pullotion into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pullotion.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hostiptal because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pullotion. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pullotion said carlos arturo plaza.

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often.? it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in his/her house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.

in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.    ",4
0151c0f,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",4
0163804,"Cars have been a necessity to us for as long as I can remember. Billions of people around the world use cars everyday. Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do.

Many places are enforcing?people?to go without there cars transporting them?everyday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, ""Seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here."" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, ""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In saying this he portraying that?we need to focus?on more important things and?stop?worrying?about cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.

Vauban isn't the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also.?Robert Duffer states, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" By saying this the author is explaining?how the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city's. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our enviroment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.

Bogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Scientist believe that Venus was once the most ""Earth-like planet"" in our solar system. in "" the challenge of exploring Venus"" the author exlaimed that "" astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". this quote shows that, even though Venus posesess a really challenging atmosphere, is worth exploring because it may once have been able to support life. further more, scientist believe that Venus, was probablycovered in oceans.

Venus is worth exploring because it was probably covered in oceans a long time ago. in the article the author said, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". this implies that, since there probably used to be water on Venus, there is a chance that Venus could have supported life at one point. because where there is water, there must be life.

in conclusion Venus is worth studying and exploring, despite the dangers it presents. because, of it's unique atmosphere and environment, and because it may have been the most Earth-like planet once, and finally because, it was probably covere in oceans. to wrap this up, Venus should be widely studied and explored because, it's important to unveal the mysteries, the blue planet is hiding underneath that thick atmosphere.",4
0187e96,"Do you think you would be able to live without your car? It would be less difficult than you think! In fact, there is a whole town named Vauban, Germany, that has given up their cars! According to Source 1, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, unless of course you have the money to buy a parking garage space for a whopping $40,000. A citizen of the car-less town, Heidrum Walter admits, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Passenger cars are resposible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas of the US, according to Source 1. If only we had more towns like Vauban, maybe our impact on the world would be less destructive.

Some towns ban cars for a few days at a time. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. Congestion in Paris went down 60 percent and the smog from the pollution cleared up enough that they rescind the ban. Some people would complain that having little to no cars will be an issue for jobs, delivery companies, or getting children to and from places. There's always a bus, and there's always the option of car pooling! Bogota, Columbia is another town that has done a car free day, except Bogota's is annual. These Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to places during the car-free day, according to Source 3. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of this annual car-free day, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in Bogota. I think more towns should ban cars for just a few days. We could all get a little excersize, help the environment, and improve our mood and lower stress!

A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, Source 4 says. The number of miles driven in the US was at it's height in 2005 and dropped steadily after. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was almost 9 percent below that peak! Some sociologists believe that if this pattern continues, it will have lots of beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, according to Source 4. Some places, such as New York, have car-sharing programs and bike-sharing programs, which is a nice way to get from place to place that's healthy for you and your environment.

There's so many reasons why we should use our cars less! Like I explained, it's very healthy for your environment, and if you choose to walk or bike, its healthy for your body, too. Also, pollution rates would go down quite a lot if we would just carpool or walk/bike to places! People have said that they feel so much happier and stress free from not using a car all the time. So why not take the time to help your environment and call somebody up to carpool, get that bike fixed, or hop on that bus!       ????????       ??????????    ",4
018ff85,"Driverless cars are the future! ""Google has had cars that could drive idependently since 2009. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far , Google cars aern't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when dealing with complicated traffic issues.'' Driverless cars have been around for a while now; even though they are not fully developed they are becoming more and more relavent and it's time to imbrace that. Imbrace that they may even help prevent any sort of crash in the future. While also getting people to thier destinations fast and saftely.

There are still problems to face even in the light of things. For example.

""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivier, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states t is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" There are still many strides to take in acheving driverless cars on rode but as soon has those obsticles are tackled everyone will be much happier. With saftey has the main concern the laws that will be made for these driverless cars will insure that the utmost care and concern for health take precident. As soon

has the laws have been made the states wil also be more open the idea of a drverless car on thier streets.

Has stated earlier there are still a few problems with the idea of driverless cars but they are really close to frution. Possibly even on the cusp on perfection. ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the rode ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

All of that simply means driverless cars are not 100 percent driverless but they very very close. If they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves thats half the battle and the rest will follow in suite with time.

""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotatng sensor on the roof, a video camera mountedd near the rearview mirrior, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciver, and an inertial motion sensor. The most impportant bit of technology in this system is the spinn sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constanctly uppdating 3-D model of the car's surrondings."" The technology is there for the drverless cars to start becoming a real prossiblity in the near future. They may even fully take over and allow for a much more easy going experinces while driving. And also allow for beyond human level control of the ride.

"" Telsa has prjected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on the autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plam to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The rode to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us. but we grow closer to the destination everyday."" Fully driverless cars really are in the near future. There are small little pushes that still must be made but right around the corner of those is a paradise of safe relaxing transportation for all to use. With driverless cars the future will be a bright one. And saftey while driving will no longer be a concern. ",4
01a39ed,"Since the beginning of time people have always wanted the next big thing. After watching many movies where cars that don't need drivers are being used, people have wanted to make this a reality. Since 2009 there have been cars that could drive independently under certain conditions (paragraph 2). However, by making these driverless cars legal it makes driving even more dangerous.

In paragraph 7 it states ,"" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" After drivers get use to this car they will be more relaxed and not as alert as usual. It will be easy for drivers to drift off or get distracted. This is because the car is doing most of the work. This could cause many wrecks that could injure not only the driver, but others on the road too.

When driving a driverless car many drivers would not be aware of their surroundings. In paragraph 8 it says , "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the in-car system is actually a saftey feature."" If drivers are texting while using a Driverless car , then it means they are not paying attention. In an emergency the driver would not have enough time to stop. If a child or animal ran out infront of the car, it would be to late. The driver would not have enough time to react and stop the car. The car would not have enough time to alert the driver.

Another con about a driverless car is who to blame when an accident occurs. Paragraph 9 states ,"" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" Many car accidents take place each day, which means the odds of a driverless car getting in an accident are probably pretty likely. If this did occur the driver could blame the manufacture saying that the car didn't alert the driver. The manufactures could blame the driver by saying that any driver of a driverless car must always be alert. This now affects not only the driver, but the manufactures and the other people in the accident.

Driverless cars would make roads even more dangerous and unsafe. They give drivers an excuse to not pay attention to the road and the things around them. This could cause very serious accidents. It is safest if cars remain where drivers are always in control. ",4
01a53e1,"In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggustion that Venus is worth studying has many thoughts in our heads. Is it really worth it? Should we consider it or focus on our planet? Well, the author has many reasons to why we should continue researching it.

A supported reason to the author belief is that it could be a back up plan for us if something were to happen to earth. in the text it says,"" Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too"" ( paragraph 2). Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. IT would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing.

Another reason is it could help us with futuristic things. Better things than what he whave right now. In the article it stated,"" Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. It would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing"" ( paragraph 5). We can find and build different tools to help us reach Venus and to study more about what could be our future planet.

While i see the authors mindset on this article, there are many con's to the ""twin"" planet. Its not very survivable land for us to stay and live in. In the text it says,""

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface. ( paragraph 3). This can cause alot of damage and lots of fear within people if we were to ever live here

The article over had good reasons to back up the authors reasons to why we should continue looking into this planet.

We need to consider the pro's and co's to everything. And i think the author is headins a good way bu wanting another planet for us to live in. ",4
01b55c8,"Fellow Citizens, there are many reasons why limiting car usgage has outstanding oppritunities and advantages.

For an example, If there aren't people out there spending their hard earned money that they worked for, for an?expensive car that they are just going to use to get to someplace faster when they could just stop being lazy for once and walk or run, ride bikes, hike, or take a bus, instead of spending money after money to fill a car up to just waste gas, and to fill it up again. Running, riding bikes, hiking, etc. gives you a chance to experience reality. Being outside gives people a chance to see the earths real beauty, and to smell the fresh air. Limiting car usage helps people stay in shape and keeps them healthy if their not just sitting in a car for half a hour when they could be running or walking.

Residents?in Vauban, Germany are permitted car ownership, but there are only two places to park : large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. About 70 percent of Vauban's families do not iwn cars, an about 57 percent sold a car to move there. Having a car makes peoples tense, and being in a place where there isnt alot of car usgae makes people much happier. People who live in places where cars arent used as oftn as other states, those towns place stores in walking distance, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

An amazing advantage?that people can can from limiting the usage of cars is less drunk drivers, or even none. If there's less drunk drivers, there's less car crashes and less deaths. Everyone understands that you have to be 21 or?older in most states to drink alcoholic beverages. The big adavntage out of this is, if older people were to get drunk, they would be forced to call a cab, or even walk home. Their not putting noone else's life in danger, and this would?lower the crashes and?death fatalities per year.

As as many cars that there is in the world, all the use of them would probably pollute the world. Paris enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of the near-record pollution.

Limiting car usage gives you the oppritunity to be with your family and friends and spend more time with them?then you normally would having a car. You can walk and talk with them on the way to work, you can stop by the park and have some fun on your way to the grocery store. The best part about this is, you dont have to worry about the roads being busy. You ca walk, run, hike, and bike without having to hear the noisy streets, the honking, the screeching, etc.

What's the point in having a car that your just going to be wasting money on, when running, walking or riding a bike is free and even?cheaper and safer than driving a car. What are you gonna do when your car breaks down? Are you gonna keep spending your money on when it keeps breaking? Why do that when you have two?perfectly good and healthy legs and you can run or walk somewhere?

Just take a moment to think about the fines every single person breathing in the world has received? Alot of money wasted on something idiotic huh? just imagine if every state, continents, islands, and places we dont know about all stopped using cars, or even just limited the car usage. We'd be saving a whole ton of money, we'd basically all be middle classes.

This whole situation is a win-win, You get to be with your family 24/7, Running, walking, biking, hiking etc. is all an amazing?way to keep people healthy. People dont have to worry about drunk drivers, or car crashes, or car fatalities. People can finally stop spending their hard earned money that they're just going keep spending and wasting on gasoline or to fix your car when its having problems and it breaks. Families can save the money that they would normally be spending on gasoline and start saving for a trip to take their family on to spend more time with them, or to take a trip for yourself.

There are plently more reasons and outstanding advantages that limiting car usage gives you, but these are some of the very best! Just remember, The only good advantages a car can give you is getting you somewhere faster, and keeping you comfortable and safe. But they are also the most danagerous, and expensive things out there. They can take your life or someone elses in an instant, and they can put you in debt quicker than you know! Limitng car usage is for you!    ",4
01bb07c,"Dear State Senator,

After conducting studies on the American voting system ,I noticed many flaws. Deciding on presidency is one of the most vital processes in any countrie,so it should be addresed properly. the fact that voters vote not for president ,but they vote for slate of electors,the electors can be anyone not holding public office,and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states? are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters dont vote for president ,but they are actually voting for electors is should be looked into because the people are not? voting for president .The are voting for people to vote for president .which throughly explains the idea that the majority oppinion of the nation is invaluable to the goverment and our society? .This system is not fair .Nor is this system equal. and nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countrie .

The electors can be anyone not holding public office .This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic .Bestowing any dreg of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea .This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. He could mislead us and vote for any canidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by canidates in 2000. which leads U.S citezens? to ask questions like:Is our oppinion valuable or even considerd valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countrie or do they want POWER?Do our votes even matter or make a diffrence ?Should we just give up on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the prepective of our founding fathers .They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were people's oppinions dont matter,With often and misleading corrupt electors? not letting the majority rule .This system should be put to an end ,So our countrie can live free again.       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?

01cbe3d,"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.

01d2df1,"The Future of Driverless Cars

Could you think about yourself not having to worry about driving your car anymore? This is becoming a possibility with all the new technology automobile companies are using to make this happen. But, there are some people that are opposed to this idea becasue of some problems that could come from this This idea also has a majority of supporters too which myself is one of them. There is some bad things about it dealing with traffic and accidents but there is stress relief for not having to drive and not worrying about the road. Also you would be able to do whatever you want while the car is driving to your destination.

I support the idea of the self driving car for many reasons that will soon help all drivers. ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" With the cars technology ability to be able to mimic the human driver is a huge factor for self driving because it can do all the driving that a human does normally. Some people especially hate driving because it casues them stress and anger so I think if every car was self driving there would be no problems, no traffic, and no accidents to worry about. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This quote is talking about how only few states let companies test autonomous cars which hinders the developement of the cars and their safety for all of us because how can you make a better car if you cant test in in real situations. This is a problem with the testing becaus ethe car cant become better and solve the problems if there is not testing done.

On the other hand of the argument there is many things still wrong with the cars and their saftey. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a big problem witht he cars because technology usually fails at some points in time and if this causes a big accident and people are hurt it will cause so much frustration and confusion on everyone invloved. Another point about the problems of the car is ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The quote has a big meaning because whats the point of having self driving cars that you need to worry about while its driving? ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The whole point of the self driving cars is its ability to be able to do these things so it should be able to switch could be developed later on.

So in conclusion the self driving cars in my perspective are a good idea but it will come with soem complications as does everythign else. This would be a huge step for the human race and would benefit alot of people. The technology will grow and the problems will become less until we have reached the point where there is no problems with the cars and their abilities.      ",4
01e0bb8,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling? With this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, it is truly possible. You can detect the emotions people are feeling through this technology advancement.

Using this new technology serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other forms of technology.

To begin, the facial recognition technology serves great purpose and value because it unlocks new discoveries in our history. With this being said, new beginnings are coming about because we know more about how Mona Lisa was feeling while Da Vinci was painting this famous portrait that is spoken about all across America. It gives insight on the deeper meaning of this painting. For example, we now know that Da Vinci must have studied the human body in order to create such a wonderful piece of artwork. In the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" Due to his great knowledge of the human body and muscles he was able to paint precise emotions and because he painted such precise emotions, people today were able to unlock how she felt during this time. A new discovery. After all, this advanced tech can now bring this history piece to life. In the text it states,""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements?in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This creates a new perspective of how we view our history and it also could unlock mysteries in our histories past.

In addition,this technology advancement was created only to help people. As consumers, we always think about, what would this do for me? With that being said, the Facial Action Coding System could have a positive affect on our medicines, entertainment, and medical technology. In the text it states,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive?for video games or video surgery."" The one thing I think about when I hear America is sports, which is a form of entertainment. The new technology could benefit our use of televisions and radios or smartphoneswhich we watch sports on. Another thing I think about it when someone is speaking about this country is medical purposes. Our country has amazing medical advances and technology. The facial coding could help create a better understanding or a better alternative for complicated technology. Then again, as consumers we also spend alot of time on social media or looking at ads. Sometimes there are things we are not interested in at all but they annoyingly still pop up. With the facial coding, our faces can be detected if we like the ad and if we do not like the ad. This benefits us greatly because it shows what we do want to see and what we do not want to see. In the text it states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different."" Many might say this does not matter but ads are everywhere and our world is only going to rely on computers, or other forms of technology so why not embrace it and try to advance too?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other technology. ",4

The landform on Mars is a mesa, and there are many like it on Earth. As the text states, ""It remids me most of Middle Buttein the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" Just because something that is here and it's known it is natural doesn't mean that on another planet it was made by or is extra terrestial.

As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This means that if there were tools, construction equipment, or anything

from ""extra terrestrials"" that they would be visible in the picture. There was nothing there but landforms and rocks.

In 1998 the best picture taken was when Mars was foggy and skeptics and theorists said that markings could be hidden. But in 2001 a new picture was taken and it showed that the landform only had the markings the rest of the planet. The red dust and rocks.

The landform on mars in natural, even if it looks like a face. You can see things closeer up in a digital image, there are many equivilent landforms on Earth that are natural, and lots of theories on the face are exagerated. Before you speculate, have your facts straight.   ",4
0226250,"In this article Driverless Cars are coming i agree with them. It would be nice to have cars that can help us drive or even drive for us. First that would be really good for peoplewho drink and drive. Then it would be the same for

people who are tired from work or an type of activity and cant drive because there just so tired.Plus i feel its a good investment in our country, instead of getting a taxi.

First i think its a good idea because the people who drink and drive now have this driverless car to take them home. There friends dont have to worry if he or she made it home safetly cause there is this car that is

keeeping them safe from driving. They wont hurt anybody or themselves. Also if they do try to drive and put there hand on the wheel maybe they should have the car sense there is too much alchahol in there system.Like how paragraph 4 said that ""they will needed a

whole lot of sensors"" for the car so maybe then can put a sensor like that put in the car.

Then the people who are tired from work and from doing something very tiring or the people who cant see even at night

and they suufer from driving and they end up up a car crash so the car can help

them out a lot because many people suffer from not seeing in the dark when they drive. Or when you

go grocery shopping and your reallly tired and cant really much for yourself the car is there for you to take you home.

Last, its a good investment for our country in paragraph 1 they mention that

""the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibllity than a bus."" so i feel why not take up that offer when there is so many companies out there that offer a taxie system, so we can replace all of that and save more money in this counry and possibly other contries. having to pay for a ride from and back can burn your pockets when you can use half that with the driverless car. I feel you can save so much more money that way ecespically when you use the taxi sytem everyday. when you think about it thats thousands a year. So i say just invest in the car and it would be better for you and me

in the the end.

In conclusion i think that driving driverless cars are good with me im totally with it in the end.",4

In an acrticle called In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars writen by Elisabeth Rosenthal talks about an upscaled coummunity in called Vauban Germany where people have given up theirs cars. In Vauban's 70 percent of the families that resided in vaubans don't own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. Even though alot of the resdients of Vauband dont use car some still due. Ownig a car is still allowed vauband uses large garages where people can? store thier cars,but a person must first pruchase a parking space for $40,000 first. While some cars are still used in the comuntiy walk or bycicle as thier means of transportation. Vauband is a prime example of of a postive growing trend. Vauband helps to reduce the green house gas emissions cars give off.

While cars can cause harm to the enviorment, cars can also cause people stress that they themsleves don't know they're dealing with. Accoriding to a a qoute found in In german Suburb, Life goes on without Car. Heidrun Walter exprees how without casr lifes is happier ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" another qoute found in Car-free day is spinnig into a big hit in Bogota says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress an lower air pollution"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo. Carlos was speaking about a day set aside where the use of cars is not permited in Colombia. Cars casue people to feel as if thier lifes revole around cars. Pepole didnt notice the effect that cars had on thier lives until they didnt have to undergo the use f cars.    ",4
023ab53,"Venus is said to be the most earth-like planet in our solar system. There are however many things that Venus makes it challenging to be studied or understand. That is just one of many very well told reasons in the article that the author provided to state why we should keep studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. THe author provides information that pushes people to want to know more.

In the article the author provides us with information on the ways how humans have studied Venus. In the the article the author tells the reader how humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study Venus but no spacecraft survived for such a long time on just landing on Venus. The author expalins that that is the reason to why no furthur studies have been made in over three decades.

Another thing of information that the author provides the reader with is to why the atmosphere is challenging for us. In the article the author provided the reader with information like the degrees and pressures of the atmosphere. In the article it is said to be over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on earth. Also on the discovery on the thirty plus miles abover surface tempatures change to 170 degrees and the pressure changed close to the sea level on earth giving the impression that its survivable for humans. This discovery make scientists want to know more on why that is the case, leading them to keep making new discoveries no matter the challenges it brings them.

The last thing the author provides its readers is with imformation on what NASA is working on to know more about Venus. The author states how NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. They are working on simplified electronics which some have in fact worked and have lasted for three weeks. It has studied and has gathered more information.

The author states many information for the reader that supports to why the idea of studying Venus is worthy of pursuit, the more interesting information she provides the more the reader would want to know. The reader would think it is worthy to pursuit to get more discoveries and know the planet further more. ",4
023c138,"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pullution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraunts and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change.""

Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the enviornment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to excercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the enviornment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to excercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.    ",4
026355a,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you may get to see new sights. You may also play fun and exiting games while your off shift or while going on the return trips. You can also help out with fun things like feeding the animals or be put on night shift.

The sights you get to see could be amazing. The thing you get to see could be amazing. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see all types of new things like new fish or new landscapes. Some off the landscapes you might not be used to, but that means that you could enjoys the veiw! As your out on the sea you can see fish that you might of never seen before. You could also see reefs that are colorful and bright!

When your on the ship it could get quite borning. You might want to do something fun. Well on the return trip you get to play all the games etc. you want. Some games for when your in the mood for somehting sporty you can play baseball and volleyball where their are empty holds where the animals were kept. You can also play table tennis, fencing, and boxing. After you played the sports you might be ready for a relaxing game such as board games or cards. If your not into those kinds of things then you can just read or whittle. There is always a fun option.

When there are tons of animals on the ship there is always work to be done. To help out you can feed the animals and/or clean their stalls. You could also pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. When you feed the animals you have to feed and water them 2 or 3 times a day. To be extra helpful you could help clean. It may not be the funnest job, but it helps a lot. When we get to our destination there are tons of animals to load off the ship. You coild help unload them or if we are back at our returning place you could help load the animals and all the supplies into the ship.

Those are only some of the reansons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Its a lot of fun, but it can be hard sometimes. You may get hurt, but thats okay. Thanks for your time.",4
02a059f,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

belives that exploring Venus is a worthy challenge despite its challenges. Based on how they have written this article I can say the that the author succeeded at laying out his claim and evidence.

The author starts off by stating facts about the star in our sloar planet from nicknames, temperature, as well as atmoshpere. The text states "" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"". the author also states "" on the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet"".

Later on in the passage the author starts to ask the reader a

questions and provides answers to them. The text sates"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, then why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"". and answers with "" Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"". This body paragraph is another eason why I believe that the author provided a good claim.

The author then continues to NASA's ideas on further exploring the harsh surfaces of Venus. The suthor states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"". Then gives more detail about the process. The text states"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"".

The author then discusses the problems about the idea that NASA has come up with and the other possible solutions for exploring Venus's harsh surface. The passage states"" peering at Venus from a ship or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limit insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffectve. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". The author also states"" NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have laster for three weeks in such conditons. another project is looking back to an old technolgy called mechanical computers"".

Based on the information that i have presented from the author's claim and passage, shows that this claim and evidence is correct and is a valid statement to be made by the author.             ",4
02a1c3a,"I honestly think driverless cars are an excellent idea. They could help drivers out a lot and possibly change transportation forever. There are a couple reasons why I believe driverless cars should happen. The first one is that driverless cars will make it easier to travel long distances. That reason is followed by the fact it'd be easier to drive if you have small children in the vehicle. And the last reason I have on why driverless cars should become popular is that there will be a lot less accidents.

The first reason I believe driverless cars should become popular is that it could make traveling long distances a lot easier than it always has been. With a driverless car, you wouldn't have to stop and take breaks due to you being tired. This would reduce the time it took to reach your destination. With the car being able to drive itself, you also wouldn't have to stop and sleep. The car could work on getting you to where you'd like to go and you could get back in control after you were well rested. I know these things seem dangerous and impossible, but I'm sure driverless car companies could come up with things to alert you if need be. Vibrating seats or a loud announcement would be good ideas on how to wake a driver if they are needed.

Another reason I'm convinced driverless cars are great is because it would be a lot easier to drive with small children. While the car is operating itself, you could look back and check on the kids a couple times. If the children were in absolute need of anything, you could take care of it while the car took care of all of you. If, by chance, you're needed to drive while your attention is focused on the children, the car could let you know. Like I said previously, vibrating seats or a loud announcement would work perfectly to get your attention but flashing lights or something like that could work as well.

The last reason I strongly believe that driverless cars are incredible is that there would be a huge decrease in traffic accidents. The driverless cars will always obey traffic laws, (proper steering, accleration, braking). People won't have to worry about drunk drivers as much either, with the car doing most of the work the driver won't be doing anything really. There's also no possible way for a car to be drunk. The last reason I have on why driverless cars would prevent accidents is that you wouldn't have to worry about bad weather unless the car needed you to navigate. Thick snow, rain, sleet or foggy windshields would no longer be an issue if cars could drive themselves.

I firmly believe in driverless cars changing the ways of transportation for good. Driverless cars can make it easier to travel long distances, uncomplicate driving with small children, and prevent vehicular accidents. Without the complications of driving when it isn't the best choice, transportation will be more simple for everyone.",4
02cbcbc,"There are many different negavtives and positives when it comes to driverless cars. Knowing the goods and bads about these special cars can be good for the future when investing in one some day. Having a car that can drive itself, communicate with you and your actions, interact with how you drive could be a good thing. What if something was to go wrong? Being able to know how these things works and whats good and not so good about them could, never know, save your life.

These new and improved cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. it goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these self-driving cars many dont know. Gm had developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in a danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Today, we don't exacly know how or what these self-driving cars are going to have in them or how they may run in the future. There are many positive things that have come upon us when investigating in this new invention but what could possibly go wrong? During the making of these cars there is a lot of technology and a whole lot of sensors. While driving thses cars, lets say on the highway, and something was to go out or mountfunction. Yes, it could happen to any vehicle in the world. The only problem is if the car itself is driving and something was to happen would the driver be able to take control or would the car freeze everything up an something bad happen? Google, BMW, and anyone else involved in this think of all the good possible things but there could be so many negatives that could really be lifechanging.

My opinion on Diverless cars is good for the most part. Say you have to drive a long ways and you need a break from driving, the car could take over instead of having to stop at night and drive for you. Its crazy to think that in a few years these cars could become our lives. ""Telsa has projectd 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" ( Driveless Cars are Coming.)

So, as you think more about it, most positive things could also be negative things when it comes to self-driving cars. In a few years havinng these cars could change our lives or make them harder. From the cars driving a half a million miles to having gadgits to help you focus on driving to not so much the technology problems that could cause bad news for a lot of people. Never know, one day we might have cars driving us around instead of us driving them.",4
02d8dd2,"The use of cars today in our modern world is crazy! Everywhere you look there's cars; going down the road, parked in a garage, or on TV. Now think of a world without them...it would be different, wouldnt it? Yes, indeed it would be, the world would be less hectic and cleaner place to live.

First, Life without cars would make life much less hectic. In Vaunban,Germany there is an upscale community where there are no cars. People either walk, ride bikes or take the public tram. A servey shows ""70 precent of Vanuban's families do not own cars, and 57 precent sold a car to move here"". People move to Vauban to enjoy a ""car-free""...stress free life. ""Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (sorce 1 paragrah 3) The ""car-free"" world of not having to worry about car payemrnt, incerance, and gas money is a whole lot better than a car dependent world.

Second, Limiting our car use would help make this planet cleaner. Pollution issues have gotten so bad that ""...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". (Source 2 paragraph 10) In paragraph 14 it states that ""after five-days of intensive smog...the smog rivaled Beijing,China, which is one one of the most polluted cities in the world"". France uses more diesel than gasoline, therefore making up 67 precent of all vehicles in France. The use of these harsh fossil feuls is a huge problem that can help be controlled by limiting our use of automobiles.

Third, Although some may argue that we need cars to fuction in our modern world, there are other options that we can choose. For example, If everyone took public transportation such as the subway we would be cutting back tremenously on the amout of feul consumed. Another advantage of using other forms of transportation other than a car would be that you wouldnt have to worry about your car not starting, or not having enough money too fill your tank. Other forms of transportation would always be reliable and convenent. You would also feel good about helping the enviornment by not adding extra gases to the ozone.

To finish up, Limiting our use of cars would make life easier and cleaner. In source 3 it states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many people are convinved that a ""car-free"" life would be much nicer than the hectic car-consumed life we've all grown so accustom too. Limiting our use of cars is a good idea for our stressful lives.    ",4
02f14c6,"The face is just a natrual landform. In the article it says that NASA'S Viking 1spacecraft was just circleing around the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption notedd a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The aunthors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

The so called 'Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASSA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Although few sientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Plant in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars

Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Iidaho,"" says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heeight as the Face on Mars."" With this imformation you can include that the monument was just a landform, not anything mind blowing.",4
03194a0,"This face has been the talk of NASA and the talk of headlines for quite sometime. The topic has been argued many times and there are many different opinions on whether or not its a face or a natural landform. What do you think?

The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this ""face"" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face. There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.

In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face. The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face.

After all the questions blew over, Directors began putting images and shots into movies which again started raising talk. In movies or films there are special effects people that are able to enchance photos and clips. So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this.

Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. Science it to greatly advanced now and if there was any form of life on any other planets NASA would atleast have an idea of it. I don't believe this is an alien artifact, because Mars cannot support life.          ",4
031ab01,"If we had a facial action coding system in every classroom, Would the students have a higher chance of suceeding? Would they get more or less help? Would this gather more attention in class? I would think so. I mostly agree with having a facial Action Coding system in classrooms to tell how the students are feeling. I disagree with some aswell. If the teachers could tell exactly how each student is feeling in class, like bored or confused, I think that they would provide more help to those students, and there will be a higher percentage of people who pass there clases. In the passage making Mona Lisa Smile, they used the technology on the painting of Mona Lisa. I think that if they used it on the students, they would be more engaged and ready to learn.

I think that the students would find more things being taught to them in class interesting. In the passage it has an example that I think would be good for the use of this software to be in schools. ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If this were to happen, I know that I would do a lot better. I feel that many other students would do better too. When we get an ad that we like, and similar ads pop up, usually they are watched. If we were in class and we felt happy, or not happy with what we are learning, The teaching style or lesson might change to something that will keep more students engaged. But I feel like their are other things that aren't so good about the software.

If the softwared was installed in every class and you walked in feeling very upset for something that maybe happened outside of class or school, you will most likely feel that way the whole time during that class. The machine might pick that up as if you are not being interested in the topic. You wouldn't get anywhere. Now if you tell the teacher that you aren't happy for whatever reason, thats a different story. But, if you're shy and you don't tell people how you feel especially if something happened to make you feel sad, angry, etc... I don't think the machine would help to much in terms of education. But if you are more engaged in learning because of the software, I think their will be a way higher chance for more people to graduate.

If you are engaged, interested, or into whatever you're learning, You will most likely be paying attention and taking in the information. If you were in class, and the software picks up that you understand whats being taught, more people would focus in that class. If this happens, more people would pass tests, exams, and graduate. After you graduate, you will have learned all the education that you needed to learn to go to college. Sence more people have the education, more people would go to college.

If we had the facial action coding system software in classrooms I think that more people would have a higher chance of succeeding, getting help, paying attention, passing tests and exams. I also think that more people will go to college. I think that more people would pay attention, be interested in what they're learning, and I think it would be easier to more students. If the software were to mess up, I think that the teachers would have more problems to deal with like getting it fixed, or just simply teach without it. If their are no problems with it, I think that this would be a very helpful tool for teachers and students.",4
03205e9,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. It is the second planet from the Sun. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about the dangers of exploring Venus. The author describes the temperature of Venus, the danger of its light, and the overall danger. Besides explains what Venus, a planet and not a star, looks like, the author also states that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""Twin"". Both planets are close in size and density. One difference is that Venus is over 200 times hotter in temperature than Earth is. The average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees in Fahrenheit. That is hotter than Earth will ever be. In In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author also states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury in closer to the sun."" In that example from the story, the author is trying to explain that Venus is so hot that it would melt anything in less then a minute.

Besides being so hot, Venus is also very bright. Venus's light is brighter than our eyes could ever see. It is so bright on Venus that not even researches can take a photo or a video of the planet. This must mean that research have to keep their distance. If they get close, they will have the risk of becoming blind or dying from the hot temperature. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" The author also states, ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" The auther is trying to explain that since researchers have to keep their distance, they can't take a sample with them to Earth. Samples from Venus would help them gain knowledge of Venus.

Venus has many dangers and risks of exploring the planet. Researches can't go to the planet because it is so hot and the light is very bright. Their machines keep melting from the hot temperature. The author in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains the dangers but the author also states, ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" ",4
032db9e,"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro (31 U.S. dollar) fine.

Bogota, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 car-free day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twenty-five dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definately see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars. These days have proven many of these claims that support the assertion that there are multiple advantages to limited car usage.       ?       ????        ?    ",4
0331f55,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future, or are they? The Article ：Driverless Cars Are Coming： allows us to believe that maybe thery＞re not a thing of the future, but actually a right now present day modification to our way of living.. Now is this a good thing regarding the safety of the common people, I believe so. Does it help or economy, lets discuss and see.

First off the article points out that google has been doing thier test runs since 2009. ：Their cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.： No one has been killed in these test runs, and how many have been killed in regular driving since 2009, the number is sad. Driving these cars arent as dangerous as people make them out to be. I would also like ot point out that these cars may be able to dive themselve's, but Google cars arent entirely driverless. They're unable to back out , and navigate through roadworks and accident, so they allert the driver in those situations. The car knows when its unsafe for it to be the one in control of driving so, its going to alert you to take over and get through this. Some of the ways engineers have allowed this is with vibrating seats, and flashing lights in the car. Some have even suggested getting a camera installed inside the car, that way the car knows if your paying attention while you are driving. Next these cars are not made so people can daze off, and text on their phones, or just not do anything in the car. Special sensors in the sterring wheel allow the car to know if you have your hands on the wheel. The cars are designed so that the driver must stay alert while drivig, and ready to jump in when roads require human skills. With all of these necessary precautions in store, and the history of how well Google has managed so far, it＞s very safe for the right driver to be behind the wheel of one of these cars.

Its the best option we have economically wise, of changing the world, and advancing the world. Smart roads were investigated, in the 1950's general motors created a consept car that could run on a special test track embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever at the front end of a car. Again Berkley tried the same thing using magnets and alternating polarity. The smart roads worked very well, but the cost of upgrading all of our roads to fit the criteria was to much of a hit to the economy, the smartest choice was to modify cars so that they could become smart enough to be dirverless. To be safe the cars have a lot of sensors installed into them. The most important sensor having to be LIDAR on the roof of the car. This sensor shootss out a laser beam to form a constantly 3-D model of the cars surroundings. To help the economy its safer to update the cars with these, then to fully update the road systems we have now.

Driverless cars are not a thing of the future, ther're a present day modification to our way of living. They're not anymore dangerous then driving a normal car, and may even be a bit safer. Also they're the best choice econoimcally that our country can provide, to improve our way of living and advance us that much further. So why not get with the new era and drive a driverless car.                                                                                                                    ",4
0345980,"Driverless cars are going to be amazing when they are released to the public.

They are very intelligent machines that can make better or faster decisions than humans can on the road. Even though they are just testing them now, they still haven't caused any accidents. Think about it, everyone who drives a driverless car will have the option to steer, so it's their choice whether their life is at risk.

Driverless cars haven't caused car-on-car accidents. The text states that driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. There have been a few cases where the driverless cars were involved in accidents, but that was because other people wrecked into them. They usually don't make road errors, but other people mess them up because of their bad driving habits.

Drivers still have the option to take the wheel if they feel, or if the car feels, like

something is wrong. The text states that driverless cars require some human skill so they would have to take the wheel at some point, but the rest of the driving is optional. The text also states that the driverless cars are also being programmed to warn the driver when they need to take control. The only drawback to this is that drivers will still have to be alert at all times incase the car needs their help.

It may take some time before they are fully safe. The text states that there are some situations where humans would have to take control of the car like pulling out of driveways or moving around construction zones. This implies that the cars can't deal with humans very well. They can still manage to get in accidents with pedestrians if those people aren't dong what they are supposed to like J-walking. It will take awhile before driverless cars are upgraded with more reliable sensors that can detect pedestrians and even animals too.

Driverless cars are going to be a huge innovation that changes the way everyone travels. Driverless cars are safe, fast decision makers, and help people get from place to place without driving the whole time. I wouldn't turn down a trip in something that has all of those great qualities. Driverless cars will truely be amazing when they are released.",4
035e589,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",4
03705ca,"To my fellow citizens all across the world I think there are a lot of advantages that come with the limited car usage. One thing is that it could save the environment from the polution of gas. Also it could save people a whole lot of money if they didn't have a car. Lastly and final statement why limited car usage is advantage is that they use the money from the car to buy homes.

For starters, their are a lot of things that come with buying a car but a lot of people dont no is that every time they start up there car their actually hurting the evironment because of the gas. Here is an example from source 2.""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". After reading that it seems to me that the pollution of the gas is becoming to be a problem all around the world and thats why we need to put a stop to it by just banning it for country to country and then eventually become a car free world. Another example I found from source 2. ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". I read that and i was like wow! I wonder why that might be well if they banned the car usage they might bring do there pollution or congestion in the city. Thats why the pollution from the gas is so bad it could actually harm or maybe possibly kill them if they breathe in that pollution on a consistant basis.

Secondly, people make pretty big sacrifices in life but one I found most interesting was that Germany residents were selling there cars to buy homes for them to live in. This strikes my eye in very many ways is that they are saving an expense they don't need and also saving the environment also. For example, in source 1 it said ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". I find that quite interesting why a family like that would just give up transportation and then I thought well they save a ton of money and also they get to move to maybe a better living environment just by limiting the car usage. People who live in Levittown, New York are good example of limited car usage because a lot of them work in the city and a lot of times driving into the city is not a very good thing to do because of the traffic. So what do they do? They don't drive a car but only to the train station were they ride the train to and from the city saving money in gas and its easier to do it that way.

Thirdly, citizens use limited car usage to save money in life because lets all face it the world we live in is tough money is hard to come by and people have car payments they have to pay every month and sometimes they cant make that payment cause they have other bills they have to pay so what do they do. They sell they car and that gives them extra money a month to pay for bills a such forth. Another thing they save from selling there car is that they don't have to pay for gas either so your probably saving some where around 200 hundred dollars in cash or credit in one month which is good. Thats another reason why selling your car is an advantage of limited car usage.

In conclusion, their are a lot of ways where citizens of the world can use limiting there car usage as an advantage. Where it might be saving the environment or selling your vehicle to buy a home or even maybe just to save money in everyday life like some citizens do in Levittown, New York. These were some of my opinions on advantages of limiting car usage in everyday life.       ?????    ",4
037545d,"The world is filled different types of technology. Apple, a major technology industry, has invented multiple types of phones, computers, watches, and televisons. Computers have evolved within the last five years and the have made a whole new world. The use of technology to read students' emotional expression is valuable because it is able to detect if a student is confused and it can track emotional-recognition.

While in school, most students do not like raising their hand or asking any questions if they are lost during a lesson because they may feel embarrassed or scared. For example in paragraph six, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" He aslo predicts, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Furtherore, Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" With the classroom computer, students may feel more comfortable and more confident in themselves because they would have the ability to learn one-on-one with an instructor to get the help they need without feeling embarrassed. In addition, the computer with be able to track emotional-recognition.

Computers that have the ability to track emotions would benefit everyone. In paragraph five it states, ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vini studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles preciesly enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" Furthermore, in paragraph six it states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad with be different."" Emotional-recognition could improve how people are feeling and help them get through the day.

In contrast, a computer that can detect emotion could not work well with some people. In paragraph six it states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad."" Also, in paragraph two it states, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" People might not like the idea of their computer knowing how they are feeling because if the computer gives them false feedback, they might not agree with the new software. In addition, people might pay money for a software that does not give them the correct emotion or the software might not work in general.

The use of technology has definetly taken over the world. With the new computer software, it is able to read how each student is feelings and how it can track the emotions of everyday people. Applying emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise could change the face of technology. ",4
039b748,"Welcome to 2016. Finally, technolgy had gotten smarter and smarter. Even smarter than some humans these days. We have finally come up with a way to make our lives even more easier. Yay! Driverless cars is a brilliant, genius idea. Having a driverless car helps better our environment, safety, and could even save you some extra money.

Pollution and global warming is a big problem. Our Earth is dying. With over population in many countries having cars that run on gas impacts our enviroment. All the fuel tha that is used is killing Earth day by day. Now, think about this. Having a car that runs on only half the fuel you would typically use? Sounds good right? Using only half the fuel we would typically use would make a tremendous differnece in our environment in a matter of a year.

Having a vehicle is a privlage. It can also be very dangerous. In the news we always here about that one person or that group of teenagers getting into a car with a driver under the influence. Then we know what happens next. When you are under the influence you do not know you are,therfore, you think you are fine to do anything especially driving. Having a driverless car may actually saves lives. If one is out drinking or doing things they should not be and decide they have to drive, that car might just save them from the unexpected.

Lastly, lets talk money. We all want to save money and buy more toys. Maybe you even want to go on a vacation to some nice beach where it is warm. How are you going to do that when you get a nice $1000 dollar spending ticket in a construction zone on I-65? Driverless vehicles maintain speed limit and know driving regulations. You may want to be going faster but your car is going to save you from getting that ticket.

Better environment, protection of human safety, and money saving is something all like to hear. This new driverless car is all that within one vehicle. Purchasing a car can be difficult. You want the best for you money. Having a car that helps the enviornment, protects you, and saves you money is the car you should be interested in. ",4

Luke also had the privelege of playing tournaments and various games on board of the cattle boat with his colleagues. You could make new friends and lend a helping hand with UNRAA.

One of the hardships of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having to take care of livestock. Luke provides information that it takes alot of hard work to maintain these animals. Some of the jobs that have to be done include cleaning pens, feeding the livestock, and getting them water. Even though this all seems like too much work, it still pays off with having the feeling of knowing you helped someone's life.

A final reason that you should join this program is that it shows hope that the world could be a better place for every nation. These people are helping provide food to citizens' lives who were affected by war. This shows a ray of sun shine to people who aren't lucky enough to have a home or food. It shows these people that they will be helped. If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you could make someone out there feel like this.

03c75d3,"Technology has evolved in amazing, big, and even complex ways. It's 2018, and there are robots that can now engage in combat, imitate humans, and open doors. It's no surprise that now there are computors that can read your emotions. Will it be benefical? I, in fact, do think this new software, the Facial Action Coding System, will be benefical, especially in classrooms. This new technology can help keep students interested in learning, awake in class, and even help teachers with teaching.

The Facial Action Coding System can indeed help keep students interested in learning. Why? First off, it's new technology. Who wouldn't be excited to get to use and experience something like this? From personal experience, I know that when I first started using computers and Ipads in middle school, it made me more excited to do work and come to class. This software can also keep students interested in learning because if the system notices the student becoming bored, it could modify the lesson, as stated in the article. When modifying the lesson, it could maybe become more animated or louder for the student's attention to be grabbed, thus spiking his or her interest.

This new software could help keep students awake in class because, as stated in the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article, if the system notices that the student is falling alsleep, it could change the lesson, make it simpler, or make it more interesting to grab the student's attention. This effect can be similar to a human instructors, which can enhance the student's mood and energy level. Usually, humans lose interest and become tired when bored or when something is repetitive, and as stated above in my first point, making the lesson more animated or louder could prevent the student from losing interest, which could lead to dozing off.

And for my last point, putting this technology in classrooms for students, could actually benefit the student and the teacher at the same time. If the program notices that the student is becoming bored or losing interest, this could be a sign to the teacher to adopt a new teaching style or change up the presentation to better engage the student. Using this as an advantage could help strengthen the relationships between the students and the teachers to ensure a better, more effective, and easier learning environment for the students and an easier, more effective teaching environment for the instructors.

The addition of the Facial Action Coding System to classrooms today will absolutely benefit not only teachers, but also students. It'll first off, keep students awake to even learn the lesson, then proceed to keep the students interested in the lesson being taught, and overall will help teachers know how to best connect with his or her students and provide the best and most effective way of teaching to them. And not only do the benefits stop here, but they go on and on, adding paint to the big picture. This software can be used in even preschools and colleges. Ensuring that the students are being taught in the best way will heighten their academic skills and will provide a promising future full of success. Just from starting with the projection of a smile.

03ce0a7,"Imagine a world with driveless cars. While that world is coming to picture, be sure to also imagine all the things that could possibly go wrong. Imagine an increase in car accidenets because a malfunction occured in one of the cars. All the money and time that is being invested in this one specific project. Teenagers no longer getting excited about being able to get their license. Seems like a not so great world to live in.

Manufactors may promise people that their smart cars are safe and reliable, nothing will go wrong. But what they dont tell people is that they messed up on a couple thounsand cars, no biggie. The smart cars are no longer alerting the driver for when they need to take over. The spinning sensor just breaks down, with no warning whatsoever. That is one of the most important parts of the whole system. Everything could go wrong. Promises are broken by family; companies can easily break promises too.

So much money and time could be put into better and more useful things. This all started back in the 1950s with General Motors. Google has had working driveless cars since 2009. All of that time and money should have been invested into something that tis world needs. The United States of America has been in debt for a long time, but instead of paying off some debt we build driveless cars.

Teenagers are excited about finally being old enough to get thier permit, their first car. That is what the majority of us look foward too. We finally feel like an adult and have some freedom. With driveless cars, how would this all work out? In the pasage it says, ""... no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.."" That is no fun. What will we have to look foward to now? No one will need cars.

I am against driveless cars. They may be what we dream of but that doesnt mean they are best for us. Malfuctions could occur which causes a rise in accidents. Possibly even death. Money and time is wasted on this project and it is not what the world needs. The world does not need driveless cars. Teenagers need to experience freedom early, by getting their license and having their own car. If we will no linger have any point for cars in the future, how will teenagers expeince the early life of adulthood? ",4
03d074f,"Mr. Senator,

I think that the Electoral College is a decent way to vote for president. But is it really the best way? Though the Electoral College elects presidents in a way favored by many, it doesn't allow for people to directly vote for the president. Because of that, the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to election by popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College can make things unfair. As stated in the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College"", ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Source 2). That statement basically says that when a voter goes to vote, they aren't voting for the president, but for someone to go and vote for them. Also, who exactly are the people we go and let vote for the person leading our country? According to the article, ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office"" (Source 2). The people who go and vote can't control who these electors vote for. That's just another way that the Electoral College can be unfair to the voters.

Along with being unfair to the voters, the Electoral College can also be unfair to other people as well, for example, the canidates actually running for president. In an article that is for the Electoral College, it states that, ""...the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (Source 3). Does this mean that the Electoral College may have been a good system a while ago, and maybe not as good this day in age? Yes, it does. Also, in the article, it states, ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" (Source 3). That being said, there is always a chance that the result of an election will not be what the country as a whole wants, but what the electors want.

To conclude, the Electoral College is a very interesting proccess that everyone should know about. But I believe that the Electoral College should be a process that stays in textbooks to be learned about, not to actually be used. The Electoral College should be gone and be changed to election of popular vote. After all, the Preamble to the Constitution says, ""We the people"", not ""We the electors"".

03d8fe8,"Imagen being in a regular classroom. Imagen yourself not understing the topic. Imagen not being able to tell the teacher you don't get it because you're afraid to be made fun of. This is what the Facial Action Coding System prevents student from experiencingwhen taught a new topic. This helps student by having the system already knowing they don't understand to topic they had just learned. Although Facial Action Coding System watches your face is wierd, it'll help out teachers and students because it'll help our classroom be more understanding, helpful, and communicate better.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be more understanding.

In the article, it states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelling simply by the look on her face (paragraph 5)."" It also states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears in you screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnet (paragraph 6)."" These quotes show that classrooms can be more understanding with this system. Because if you frown, the teacher will be notified and will ask if you understand yet or need help. And this system will help teachers to more ""calculated"" of what their class needs more work on. And understand the topic they have learned.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be helpful. In the article it states,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor (paragraph 6) ."" This means that this system can be helpful by providing information to the teacher. And so the teacher can have an effective teaching plan to help out the class in learning the topic better. So they don't get lost and confused on the topic.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms communicate better. In the article it said,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. ""Most humans communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to undersatnd that, too(paragraph 6)."" This all means that this sysytem will help us communicate better. And because most of human communication happens nonverbally. It won't be too diffcult to do. This system will help the students and the teacher to communicate with each other effectivly without saying a word.

In concluion, better communication, more helpful, and more understanding are some of the pros of having the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom. Although having the Facial Action Coding System watch your face is pretty weird. Other than that, it's pretty cool that it can help the student(s) and the teacher. The students get a chance to work together to help the teacher understand them better. This system helps them communicate better overall. And helps the teacher to create a better and effective teaching plan overall, too. This Facial Action Coding System helps the student and the teacher to understand, comunicate and help each other.

03da458,"I feel like driverless cars are a great idea. It's truly great from how i see it a sign of the future. People should really see this on a positive note, you get so much from a driverless car. Driverless car is the future of things it is for the better of mankind. Hopefully people see it the way i see it.

You get so much from a driverless car don't know why some states would outlaw the use of driverless cars I could see why they would worry, for the pedestrians, drivers, and passengers. cause after all safety is the most important but if they would actually overlook the bad consiquences and see driverless car use isn't bad. After all the way the driverless cars are being made now are way more safer with all new features. All these car companies making driverless cars I'm pretty sure they're making it way safer. The law should be taking out of these states and see how safe driverless cars are.

The driverless car has all these great features that I do not understand why some would be against it. For example, BMW announced the development of "" Traffic Jam Assistant"". Which means that the car can handle driving funtions at speed up to 25 mph, but the touch sensors it has make sure the driver has their hands on the wheel. It's come pretty far to where the car can steer, accelerate and brake themselves. Also GM

has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is about to back into an object. Also thoughts of some manufacturers consider using camers to make sure the driver is focused on the road.

The future is near with how it's come from driving to driverless cars. all the technology going into this car and off like the specially designed roads for specially designed cars. also car manufacturers like Audi, Mercedes Benz, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. That is coming soon we're in the year 2016 and it's just 4 more years away the future is calling. Driverless cars are just the beginning of the future nothing better than that.

In conclusion I am all for driverless cars like I've said it's a great Idea. With all the technology in the self driven car and the beauty in it. Sure some states and people are against it with worrying about safety and thats understandable but soon they'll see all the good a self driven car can be and some states will go down on that law. Also like i said it is the future for driving and we'll need to adapt we always have and i know we''ll adapt to driverless cars. I approve driverless cars.",4
040ba87,"I argue in changing the electoral college , popular vote would be a chance for normal americans to get there voice heard in the government. A big problem is how the voters votes go straight to the electoral college and wouldnt make a change at all also how theres a bigger chance of a tie happening in the electoral college then by popular vote

One reason why the electoral college should go is because the voters votes arent really being heard. For example in paragraph 10 it says that ' under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect for the president "" , thats techinally saying that the electors are the ones who are really voting our voice means nothing we could have wanted another president to have won but if the electoral college gets more votes then us then so be it , thats our new president! We dont even know who the electors really are they could have been picked by anyone like how it says in paragraph 10 they could have been picked by the presidential candidates themselves who knows. They say we control who the electors vote for but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane.

A second reason is how theres a bigger chance of electoral college tie happening then a popular vote one like how it says in paragraph 12 "" in 1916 , a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and a 3,3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"". If the electoral college has a tie then theres even a bigger chance of the people voice not being heard at all. Once a tie happens the election goes to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president as said in paragraph 12 , a single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have no say compared to the 55 representatives from California that makes Wyoming have no voice in the election compared to Califorina. The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

Finally thats all i have to say regarding how the election should be changed to having the popular vote determine the president , we want our voice to be heard! Sometimes the electoral college doesnt pick the president that we wanted and if there was a tie to happen in the electoral college which is at high risk some of the states voices wouldnt get heard at all , thats why we should switch over to popular vote maybe more people would actually get up and go vote because they would know their vote actually means something. Like it says in paragraph 14 "" Abolish the electoral college! "".    ",4
040bb8a,"I feel as though driverless cars are very contoversial. The are some pros and cons to having a computer control a car. With that being said I feel as though driverless cars are not something that should happen, at least not now. There are far too many complications that come with not having to drive.

There is a fine line between needing something and deserately wanting it, and I feel as though cars that don't need drivers are something that people just want. I feel as though the amount of people that need driverless cars pales in comparison to what else could be done with the money that is spent on driverless cars. In the passage, it clearly stated that an idea for driverless cars is ridiculously expensive. Granted the idea was from the 1950s, but there is no doubt that to total cost of driverless cars would still be outrageous. Driverless cars just seem unneccesary because the money spent on driverless cars could go towards something better, like starving children or homeless people.

Another flaw of having driverless cars are the danger of it. Technology is no where near perfect and one small mistake in the car could cause a ginormous car accident. What if a child darts out infront of a car, and there is no driver to stop it? What if there is an accident and the driverless car doesn't detect it? There are too many possibilities for something that isn't a neccessity.

So far driverless cars aren't even driverless. People still need to sit in the front seat and they still need to be alert at all times. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating throigh work zones and around accidents."" Also there isn't a set date for when the driverless cars will get done. Car companies plan on releasing some driverless cars in 2020, but there are compliations that could arise and slow down the process.

Driverless cars seem cool and they could make things easier for the human population. However cars that don't need drivers are something that the world doesn't need right now. There are too many ""what-ifs"" that come with driverless cars. Besides there are more useful things that people could be putting their money, focus, and time on. Building shelters for people in need, donating food and water to sountries that have a lack of, and attempting to make the world a safer place for people are thing that people should be focusing on. Not just a new car that seems cool.",4
041804e,"Are you confused, angry, or sad? What if a computer could help you understand more to take away your confusion. Technology has been advancing little by little and we are at the point in time where a computer is now able to read your face and emotions. Two professers have been working hard to create a new software that can recognize emotions. They are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The use of technology in the classroom is huge. Most students are now learning lessons planned by their techers' via laptops and etc. Sometimes students struggle to comprehend their teahcer's lessons and tend to be confused because of the way they are taught. Every student learns a different way and sometimes the teacher runs out of options to help the student understand. Now, computers have a different mind. They are more ""intelligent"" than humans. They can program different things for different people. This new software could be very valubale in a classroom because it can help explain things in ways that a teacher can't and will be able to adjust to the students comprehension.

Math can be a very stressful and difficult subject to comprehend. Sometimes teachers cant explain how to solve an equation easily which is how computers could help do those things. If you're reading through your teachers lesson and see his/her explanation on how to solve but you don't quite understand it, you tend to make a face of confusion. The computer may read that and see that you are having difficulty understanding the issue and may make the work easier for you to understand.

Last but not least, some student's tend to get frustrated or annoyed and decide to give up. A student giving up is not a good thing because they then don't learn what they were meant to learn. The computer may notice that a child is getting annoyed or upset and can find a different more fun and entertaining way to help the student. Just a simple change in the form of the lesson may give a student motivation to learn instead of quitting and giving up. Sometimes all a student needs is for something to be adjusted to their understanding and level.

This software created by two professers could be very valuable in a classroom. There are many benefits it could bring but there are some problems it could cause as well. Overall, this software will have a positive effect to help a child know they can be helped to understand what they dont. It could produce a new learning enviornment to the students comprehension and many test grades and etc could improve. ",4
042b0cd,"State senator I ask that you favor the idea of keeping the Electoral College instead of changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

Even though the Electoral College is a despised method for choosing the president it has it's reasons. I'll show you why I am in defense of the Electoral College.

We need a president that would regard all of our interests and concerns. Someone can't just appeal to one region and expect to win because "".. a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president.""(source 3) due to no region having the amount to guarantee the electoral votes to elect a president. Dealing with votes it is a problem to have a run-off election. One of the concerns with Electoral College is that "".. voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" stated in source 2. But the Electoral College simplifies that problem with the electoral votes. Remarked in source 3 it says ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively.)"" without the Electoral College it would have complicated the election procces but thanks to the Electoral College reduces the complication and produces a clear winner.

To win, the majority of the states have a system that gives all the electors votes to the winning candidate except Maine and Nebraska having their own way of proportional representation which is explained in source 1. This gives the certainty of a result, for example in source 3 it says that "".. even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landside electoral-vote victory in that state"" this makes it highly unlikely for a tie. The Electoral College gives political balance to large states (population wise) higher the population the more problems, concerns ,or interests is needed to be attend to. Like how source 3 says "" .. a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...""

To me all these reasons should prove to you that even though the Electoral College has its problems it's benefits outweigh it. So being in favor of keeping the Electoral College is the right choice don't you think so too?    ",4
044b201,"With the years, we have changing many things in our society. Since technology, by making new electronic devices, to things in our government, by making new laws and new things to help people in all the country. But, does that mean that we have to change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the presindet of the United States? In my point of view, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution. And there are many evidence to support that keeping the Electoral College is beneficial to our country.

According to the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of Romney. Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landsalide electoral vote vistory in that satate. This demostrates, how people accept the fact that they are voting the electors and then for the President and Vice president. This help people by making easily the hour of vote for a candidate.

However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this. For example, in the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, the author says that according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. (Posner, paragraph #16).

Another evidence from the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised mothod of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner,? is when he says ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"" (Posner, paragraph #19). That means that No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavely in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing huis plurality in states that he knows he will win. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" That highlights how the Electoral College is trying to helping people vote their candidates and feel safe and comfortables with them.

To conclude, despite the fact many people say that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting? a president, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution that helps our community to help people with thir desicions and make our life more comfortable and easy.

04575a9,"The Disadvantage of Facial Action Coding System

According to TechGen, about 72% of students in the United States get distracted from a technological device, this can be a cell phone, computer, smartwatches, and more. Everyone has at least on technological device. Schools worldwide should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a distraction to students, they are a waste of money, and certain students do not want to show their emotions without being told to.

First, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they can be considered a huge distraction for students. Students worldwide need to learn the materials that is needed in order for them to graduate, the Facial Action is not going to help them at all. Students will also be distracted by it, and they will have a hard time focusing on what is going on in the classroom. If schools put the Facial Action System in all of their classroom, then it's going to be harder to the teacher and/or professor to get the students engaged in the activity. This technological system can be a big waste of money for classrooms.

Next, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a waste of money. According to TechPort, technological devices are increasing every single day with more things being imported to them. Schools have better things to spend their money on, such as sporting equipment, new choices of food, and extension of school building. Putting this Facial Action Coding System in all classroom can be schools go in debt because they'll have a difficult time paying materials off. There are certain students who do not want to show off their emotions.

Finally, schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because certain students do not want to show off their emotions without being told to. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Most of the time students do not want their classmates or teachers to know how they are feeling because it can be embarassing for them to know. Students can be going through a rough time, and it can be discouraging for them to go to classroom knowing that the teachers know how they are feeling.

According to Techop, 62% of all classrooms in the world have at least one computer or technological electronic in their classroom. The majority of the students have at least used a device in their classroom. Schools should not invest in Facial Action Coding System because they are a distraction to students, they are a waste of money, and certain students do not want to show their emotions without being told to.

045c7fb,"Bases on the passage I think it would be a good idea to have technology read your emotional expressions in the classroom. Then again students in the class room might not be okay with it. For example,if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow,and it can tell if your becoming confused or bored. Some of they reasons of why Eckon created the new technology might be a little to much of the kids that rather look at the walls and be bored.

In order to get students to want theis new technology, we need to make the school and the creator find more ways to get them to understand why we need it. Make them understand why we feel that we need it. Also give them reasons on why we feel it should be valuable. And what can happen if we did have this type of technolgy.

Since we live in a digital world i feel that people and the students do not really understand why it could be okay to hvae new technology to read your emotional expressions. I think we need this techology for more then one reason. We need this technology because lots of kid go home complaing about why they are stressing so bad. They also got home complaing about being bullied abd not ahve enough time to do their home. And i know teacher now these days try to find better ways to make kids not go home complaing about anything,because there are better ways to get through the problem.

I honestly think that if we did have this new technology to read kids emotioal expressions when would not have as much problems like we do now. It's not bad to try something new for once. Just think about how do you think teachers our school feel when were not paying attention to anything they be talking about. Or how they ask us a question and we have no idea what in the world is going on. Having tchnology would be great for our school,and for our teachers,because they need to know how we feel about they lesson were working on. Teachers also need to know how much kids know.

Having technology that could read your emotional expression would be a big deal. At least for meand the teachers I think,because for me I honeslty sometimes have no idea what in the world be going on when the teacher is talking the same time when i'm trying to get it in my head or understand it my self. Come on now the technology can help you in school. Why not try to have something helpful for you and for your teachers,let along your parnters also. I know yout parents get tried of you kids coming home complaing about how you have so much homework and how you have time to get any of it done. Well here's some help since you students talk about having so much home,not being able to get it done on time,and being bullied at school. Put your phone down and put your head in some books. I bet if you put your head in somes books then you won't be complaing about having some much homework,not being able to get it done on time,and be bullied everyday. Cell phone usage does cause drama and emotional problems. Technolgy to read students emotional expressions would be the best idea in the world to read students emotional expressions,because some kids need it. Even if they feel like they don't, i bet you they do. Not just for the teachers but for the parnters and theirsleves to.                  ",4
0467e2a,"Life without cars may seem like a distant dream, but dreams are becoming a reality with new expiremental towns,? banning of driving in some cities, and a national day without cars. Cars are causing, in some cases, more and more pollution everywhere. Although we ignore the signs of pollution everyday, we must face the fact that we are polluting our planet, and something needs to be done about it.

Vauban, Germany. A little city that has a strange law, to live in this city, you must give up your car or pay $40,000 to park it. As a result, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move here"" stated Source 1. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and a media trainer stated, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"".? This new form of seperate suburban life from auto use is called ""Smart Planning"".? passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissionsin Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States.? With Smart Planning, we can cut back on greenhouse gasses and start to breathe cleaner, healthier air.

Another example of over pollution problems due to cars is Paris, France. Source Two states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"".? Congestion was down 60 percent for those five days. The reason there was so much smog in the air was due to the diesel fuel. Diesel fuel is the mail fuel used in France, 67 percent of the people there use it.? Another factor could be the climate there. With ""cold nights and warm days caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Stated in Source Two.

Europe isn't the only continent seeing change. Bogota, Colombia was celebrating its 3rd straight year of, Day Without Cars. The Day Without Cars is a banning of cars and only busses and taxis are permitted.? Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". For the first time this year, two more Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar are taking part in this Day Without Cars.

America too is seeing change with cars.? The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005, but has been steadily dropping after. As of April 2013, 'the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the county was in January 1995"", states Source four.? Although the drop in car usage will have a benificial effect on the environment, it will have negitave implications for car industries.? Ford and Mercedes are already taking steps to rebrand themselves to ""mobility"" companies.? Although car companies aren't the only ones changing their ways due to the drop in car usage.? New York started a new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing.? They have started building more bike paths and tunnel tolls are reflecting the new priorities.

Cars have done enough damage to this earth and its time we fix what we have caused. With all these new eco-friendly and car lacking ideas, we are so close to the isea where we can live without cars taking over our life.    ",4
048b9b6,"We, the people of the United States, live in a car happy society. Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for mostly every kid, that means that they go get their drivers liscense and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars. It is detramental to our country.

In case you haven't noticed lately but there is alot of polution in the air.

According to article 1 , anywhere up to 50 percent of car-intensive areas in the US make up the greenhouse gas emissions. It is depressing seeing all of this smog and polution in the air everyday. Just a little heads up but the polution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravogant and extraordinary country go to crap due to polution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eye sore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and polution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.

People today care alot about making and having alot of benjamins (

money

). Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.

Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.

Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our polution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country. I know it will change it and make it better! ?       ??    ",4
04a4399,"The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools to help students. There are benefits to this system, but the bad outweigh the good. This technology used to reconize emotions will affect students in ways that aren't necessary, and cause unwanted problems in the classroom.

Firstly, the article metions this system being used on computers while students are working to analyze their emotions. The author writes "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (Alto 6). Having a computer watch students' facial expressions while working could make the students feel uncomfortable and give them anxiety. Being uncomfortable while working will effect the way a student learns. They will not be focusuing on the material they are learning, but instead the idea that they are being watched. This is a problem that's not needed in the classroom and can be avoided.

Secondly there are tons and tons of emotions a human can express. The author writes "" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (Alto 3). Having only classified six emotions, is not a very wide range. What if for example, a student were to show an emotion that the computer doesn't have programmed and reconizes it as somthing else, changing the lesson to fit the wrong emotion? This would cause the lesson to be changed when the student didn't need it to be. This creates a technology problem along with the problem of fixing the lesson and wasting time the student could be using to learn.

Lastly, having a computer analize a students emotions while working would leave the teacher with nothing to teach or help the students with. This might seem like a good thing at first, but teachers create the classroom atmosphere and keep students ingaged in learning. Why have a computer analyze student emotions when teachers have been doing it perfectly for years?

The Facial Action Coding System is a great advance in technology, but when it comes to schools, the System should not be used. It only creates problems that are not needed. These problems could be avoided by not using the system.",4
04af97d,"Driverless should not be used under any condition. Driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. We should never risk ourselves or others just because we are lazy and dont wanna drive. If we left everything to these driverless cars many pepole could die. Driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets.

To begin, Driverless are carless. Driverless cars can not stay allert like a human can. In the passage it states, ""They can steer, accerlate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". This shows that a Driverless cars just does not have what it takes to be out on the road. If a kid ran in the middle of the street, unsuspectingly, the car would not have time for the human to take over and the kid would be severly injured or worse. It just is not worth the risk.

In addition, Driverless cars are not advanced enough. Driverless cars may have sensors and take extra steps in safty but technology just is not there. The pasage says, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". In the future we may have the power we need to have driverless cars, but in this time now we do not. Many states even have laws that will not allow driverless cars to even be tested in that states.

Finally, They are not reliable. All technology has flaws and that can not be helped. The passage even states, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver ot the owner?"". This is a good point, The car technology may seem flawless, but many factors come into play with something this big. The car may have a maulfunction that no one could have predicted, and many pepole could be injured or killed. This driverless car just is not reliable enough to risk the lives of innocent.

Driverless cars are a very nice idea and would be helpful, However driverless cars just are not safe. These driverless cars are careless, imperfected, and unreliable. Many factors play in even ones we can not fully predict when it comes to technology. Its not worth the risk of pepole getting hurt just because we get lazy and do not want to drive.

04bc9b6,"Face On Mars

Have you ever wondered if there was possibly other life forms out there, living on other planets? In 1976, NASA'S spacecraft ""Viking 1"" was circling Mars and taking photos. Suddenly, it spotted a form that almost looked like a human face. Some conspiracy theorists assume and consider it to be evidence of other life forms, while NASA knows it's just another landform on Mars. It's common to have forms like that around Cydonia, it's also proven that there is no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually show that it's a martian similar to land forms here on Earth. All the evidence NASA has brought upon us has proven that it is just another land form on Mars.

Firstly, it is common around Cydonia to have land forms as such. NASA

has taken plenty of pictures of Mars to know that it's quite common for there to be land forms like this. Although it may have unusual shadows, NASA could only wish that there would be possible evidence of ancient civilization on Mars. It being common, creates a slimmer chance of it being crafted by other life forms.

However, when Mars Global surveyor in April 5, 1998, Michael Malin was able to snap pictures with his Mars Orbiter Camera team. These pictures were much more clear. When the image was first revealed on a JPL web site, they realized it was only a natural landform. There was no alien monument to be seen. This strong evidence shows that with a clear image, there is no sign of any alien monument.

Furthermore, the pictures show that it's a Martian equal to a butte or mesa lanforms, seen around the American West. This evidence clearly shows that it's related to Earth land forms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This Earth landform is only a lava dome. The height is similar to the height to the face on Mars. These landforms being equal, show that it's normal to have land forms such as the Face on Mars.

But, perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze, and there could be possible evidence that aliens are indeed out there. Maybe a closer look into the image would clearify these statements. However, as likely as it sounds, the pictures taken were accurate, with an advanced camera.

Nevertheless, the chances of this Face on Mars being created by aliens is proven false. NASA

may hope that someday they might discover evidence of other life forms. Until then, they have supporting explanations on why it's not. For it to be common to have land forms like the Face on Mars, gives enough clearification. As well as, there being no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually showing a land form similar to ones on Earth. We never know what the future holds, so will NASA ever discover facts that support the conclusion of there being life on other planets?    ",4
04d2b73,"Do you really need a computer to express your emotions? Updates in technology have found ways for a computer to track facial movements to detect human emotion. This allows computers to detect your emotions before you do. We are told to answer if this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that this techonlogy is not valuable in a classroom.

My first reason for thinking its not valuable is because it doesn't provide any benefits to the classroom. Why does our expression or emotion need to be known by the teacher or computer? Education doesn't have to be amusing or easy. Thats the point of learning. Emotion isn't taken in to consideration when we are assigned homework.

Secondly, my reason for disagreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because looks are decieving. Let's say for example a stuent is doing perfectly well on their assessment and sees how much time has gone by. They are confused, but only for a second. This is sent to the instructor as a message of confusion on the topic. This has caused an unnessisary interuption on the assesment. Computers can't detect every emotion, and they surely can't detect where the cause of that emotion is coming from.

In contrast to my argument, one could say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions gives us an davantage. For example ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. I would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they should ask questions. Also, it is natural to not take interest in the lesson. Boredom is commom in school, but that should not impact the ability to learn.

In conclusion, the technology provides no real benefits to a classroom, neither to a student. Bringing this technology to a classroom would be a waste of time. Emotions are decieving in school and don't have to be acknowledged by a computer. This is why I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",4

Venus was once the earths like plante in the solar system. Scientists want to study venuse even though it dangers to see why its not like it use to be. The old venus was just like earth years ago but then it started changing with the years. In the passage it said that "" Astronomers are fascinatesx by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earths-like planet in out solar system"" (Paragraph 4, Sentence 2). This means that they are really into the thing that Venus was once like Earth. They want to keep studying it until they have something to compareit to Earth with.

Venus was once covered by oceans years ago. Another reason why sciantists want to study Venus is because Venus was once covered with bodies of water and want to see why that changed. In the passage it said that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (paragraph 4, sentence 3). This means that they are really fasinated by the way that Venus just went from being bodies of water to having eruptions of volcanoes all the time and earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All these stuff have changed Venus completly and they want to figure out why.

Scientists want to understand why not one single spaceship has made it to Venus without falling apart. In the passage it says that "" Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (Passage 2, Sentance 6). This means that they have not been able to make any spaceship land on Venus. Maybe it could be the 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus has or the acid in the atmosphere that Venus has. All the spaceships have not survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is also working on other stuff so they can approach Venus such as electronics made of silicon carbide and has lasted for three weeks.

In conclusion people think that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. One reason for that is because it was once the earths like planet in the solar system. Another reason is because Venus was once covered by oceans. The last reason is because they want to understand why no spaceship has ever made it to Venus to actually try to get samples and other stuff to study it.      ",4

Although many organizations tried to tell teenager to ""Stop Texting while Driving"", it is not effective, because in these day more teen are being pressure by technology whether it is in TV or Internet and they want to be cool. That's why having Driver less can help reduced the death rate. For example, if you're driving and text message pops up, you can let the car drive by itself and text. In paragraph 2, it said that the cars have been driven more than a million miles without a crash which mean that teens and young adult can let the car drive for a couple hours and text which can save their life. Not only does it can help reduced the car crash rate, it can also help you save money.

Traveling is fun things but nowaday not many people travel or goes to roadtrip anymore because one of the main problem is that they don't have the expenses to paid for the fuel or spending too much on fuel can decrease the amount of money they can save. If they do secceeded on having the driverless car and the fuel cost less to use it, then it would be great for many people. More people will be able to save money. Not only that, it will greatly help with the growth of our economy.

Last but not least, the function of the car is beyond our senses, because not only does it drives by itself but it can also elert driver when someting is wrong. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead required human skill"" paragraph 7. In case of emergency whereas the car are not capable of functiong need the driver to take over, it can elert the driver to take over. Also in paragraph 7 it said, ""This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drive's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed drive's seats that vibrate when vehicles is in danger of backing into an object"" So, when it required the drivers to drive, it can vibrate their seat to get their attention. I think it's a great idea to have that in it because it can prevent running into conflicts.

To conclude that having driverless car can help reduced the death of teenagers and young adult. The car can take over when people need to text or make a phone call, and it can drive for you when you're distracted by your surrounding that you can focus on the roads which can help reduced the chance you'll have accident. Not only that, it can help you save money. By spending less in the fuel, you can keep some change in your pocket. Also it can help drive for you when you got to sleep or take a nap if you're in long roadtrips. It support safety for the drivers, whereas the system elert the driver if the car encounter a problem and needed the driver to take over. That's why having driverless car can help our daily life and improved the way we live.",4
04dbd25,"Limiting car usage could come off as absurd to some people. They ask ""Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?"" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more conveinient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevelant in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have possitive effects on the environment.

The greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowldge that the Earth is in a state of self-destruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmuful emissions come from cars and other gas-powered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of grenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the? United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environemnt that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article ""The End of Car Culture."" The article states that a limit to car usage would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions."" This article does not only say that cars are? large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.

Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous.       ?       ?    ",4
04df837,"""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesnt really list any benefits to exploring Venus.

Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to.

Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. The author writes "" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?

In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.",4
04f47a5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author includes many benefits and dangers that come with exploring Venus. Venus is known for its uninhabitable atmosphere and environment, but scientists believe that long ago Venus was the planet most similar to Earth. In this article, the author believes that humans should go beyond the limits of dangers and supports his or her idea well with inspiring points that motivate anyone to look past the boundaries. The author lists the extreme dangers of Venus, and then answers why scientists are so set on exploring it.

The author first regards the dangers of Venus. The author explains the problem to finish with a promising solution. The author gives dreadful facts that prove the planet is extremely inhospitable for any human and even some space crafts. The author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" The author does not say this to frighten anyone but to blunty state what the NASA scientists are up against.

Further into the article, the author answers the important question ""why?"" Why would anyone want to put themselves at these risks? Why is Venus worth all of the trouble? The answer is, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author wants people to realize that Venus has the potential to be almost identical to Earth, but the author also includes that scientists cannot be certain without further exploration. The potential of Venus being another part of our world is certainly going to excite many astronaunts and explorers to go make it certain.

Venus has the potential to hold an exciting new world, but the dangers astronaunts and scientists must face are lethal. The author paints a new possibility in this article by describing the potential Venus could hold. This article clearly shows how the author informs about the dangers of Venus but then answers why the scientists are to eager to get to know this planets. With the way the author gives inspiring points about exploring this planet, anyone can look past the dangers and see a new world.  ",4
04fcfb0,"A commonly known and disputed topic is the ""Face on Mars."" You may believe that what is known as the ""Face"" is actually a formation created by aliens. Pictures from twenty-five years ago show the ""shadowy likeness"" of a human face. If you believe that the nearly two mile formation was staring back at the cameras was a face, the main reason this formation could not possibly be a formation of a face created by another life form on a different planet is because there is no scientific evidence of aliens to be discovered.

The Face has recieved national recognition as being a representative for most pop icons, Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. But because the Face is a popular icon, the way the face is portrayed to have been created and used for has been taken out of context by audiences around the world. Spin-off series about the Face and aliens have promoted the idea that aliens are real, although there is no scientific evidence to be found. The media that used the Face has promoted audiences to believe that the Face is actually a formation made by aliens, as a way to keep their audiences interested and to make more incom by their audiences believing their predictions of aliens.

As a result of the majority of people believing that the Face was an alien artifact, NASA decided to fly over the formation again to take a new picture using an updated camera that was ten times sharper than the camera used originally to take the first pictures, in order to investigate if he formation was really made and occupied by an alien life form. The new pictures concluded that

what seemed to be an alien life form was actually just an actual landform. Yes, there may be different and unusual kinds of makrings on the land form because it is located on a different planet where there are different conditions occurring.

What has now been proven to show that the Face is a natual landform is that the landform is the Martian equivalent of a buttle, which are landforms common around the American West.

Whether you believe or don't believe that the landform on the Red Planet is made by aliens, there is more authentic evidence that is relevent to showing that the landform is just a natural occurrence, rather than evidence presented by science fiction enthusiasts. Although the formation may seem to have the appearance of a face, there are also many natural objects on Earth that have the appearances of faces too. So, making assumptions because of a conspiracist's predictions does not automatically make your assumption correct.   ",4
0509d92,"In addition to, the story people think that the Face was created by aliens. In this essay i will be talking about, Whether or not people have proof or evidence that the Face was created by aliens?, What would make people think that the Face was created by aliens?, and How do you think this if you just found out about the Face?.

With that being said, Do you think these people that thought the Face was created by aliens have proof or any type of evidence?... I don't think they had proof or any type of evidence because it was on Mars people csn not go around assuming that it was created by aliens if they have no proof. People would have to go to Mars and see for theirselves. Just because it was founded on Mars doesn't neccesarly means that it was created by aliens.

Next, What makes people think that the Face was created by aliens?. Is it because they knew that it came from Mars?... I strongly believe it is because all these people knew that it came from Mars, i'll tell you why i think this. I think this because it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stores as stated in paragraph 5. So, because it appeared in so many places people started to make assumtions, and really believed that the Face was created and made by aliens.

Futhermore, How does people think this if they just recently found out about the Face?. Well, people think this just because it it was the most popular story or myth going on at the time and since it came from Mars that it was created by aliens because they know people doesn't live on Mars.. But, that doesn't mean human beings do not visit to see what it is like in person.

In my opinion, last but not least, people should not make any assumtions before they don't know the full story or the truth behind it all and to ask people who was it created it by and stop always thinking they know everything and making a lot of assuming statements, to where it makes a huge rumor around the world.",4
05182bf,"Unmasking the Face on Mars. If I were to be a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks the face was created by aliens. I would prove them wrong, because there are many objects that have some sort of illusion in them. This story tells how the Face is just a simple landform which I believe it is. It's a natural landform because when astronauts were circling around the planet they found it to be a simple landform. Seeing new things that look just like human things can just be an illusion to our eyes, for example the red planet could have had the ""Face"" carved into it.

I think that there are objects that can always fool our minds especially planets. There are certain planets that give us many illusions and we just want to go and figure out why they make us have such an illusion towards nonimportant things. The image of the Face that was spotted in Mars first appeared on a JPL web site, which means that the image was first taken by NASA. I believe that aliens do not exsist still and there could have been no way that the Face was created by one of them. Neil Armstrong was the first astronaut to ever be on the moon and when he came back from the moon he left his steps on the moon. The Face could have been created by someone who has visited Mars (Red Planet) even though the planet almost is the same temperature as the sun they could have taken a pocket knife and began to crave in a human face.

The Face was spotted on Mars, but the certain place that it was spotted was a lava dome, what is a lava dome you may ask?. Well, a lava dome is a place that is isolated from a mesa and can be up the same height as the Face on Mars. There are still some scientist that believe that the Face was someting that aliens created when it could've been a person or even people that wanted to leave a trace left behind. Maybe they left a trace left behind because there probably wasn't anybody who has been there before.

The Face was spotted by NASA and when NASA spotted the face they made sure to zoom in on what looked like Face. I believe that the Face was carved or traced behind due to a human being there, even though they say aliens live in Mars there could be no way that a alien did a cetain thing. Aliens could not have been the ones who left the illusion of a Face because some studies show that aliens were not exsisting at that time. The story also does not state anything towards aliens being on a certain planet especially Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that things you leave on a planet can not always be something a alien did or has done. Our mind has such a great technique to play with our minds, especially if we see things from above like the Face was seen from above. I do believe the Face was just a natural landform. I believe it was just a natural landform because there are some things on planets that have such and illusion into them.",4
0519419,"Dear Mr.Senetor,

My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn't because it's not fair for everyone. That is why i believe the Electoral Collge system should be no more.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" It's not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn't fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opporitunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don't give them a chance.

""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states...Voters in the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing they are going to decide the election."" Yes, the toss-up states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the ""swing"" states. They are just as good as the people who want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because he lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!

So in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn't only get to be the electors decision on who gets to be President, but it also shouldn't be based off the more known states. Give other states, ""swing"" states, a chance too. That is why i say the electoral system should be no more.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME                                                                                           ",4
0540b80,"I am personally against the idea of self driving cars. Why you may be asking yourself, am I against an idea that could possibly be revolutionary? Well that's because of how dangerous and irresponsible the whole idea sounds like. We already have enough accidents as it is. Why add more chaos by throwing in cars that can drive themselves? The idea itself is very unrealistic and is just awaiting to be produced to cause trouble.

Firstly, why are we so dependent on technology? Why is it that we create so many inventions to make regular things even better? We should simply be improving where we are going wrong, not distracting ourselves with new toys that have just came out ; figuritevly speaking of course. We rely on electronics so much that most people woudln't be able to function without having a cell phone or a game system.

Now don't get me wrong, some electronics have truly changed the game for us. We can fit loads of data and information on a single piece of metal. We can talk to people across the world, and travel is as good as that as well. Though most of these inventions depend on a human to operate them. Must we create something that doesn't have a rational mindset? Computers don't have emotions the last time I remembered.

The idea is also extremely unsafe. I already mentioned car accidents that may possibly happen, which they will. Though responsible adults are not the only people who drive on roads too. Teenagers who are learning to drive won't even need to know the basics of the road thanks to these self driving monsters! Teens are the most likely to get into car accidnets than any other age group. Just the thought of a young 15 year old on the road, not knowing how to drive an actual car sounds morbid.

The point that I am trying to get across is not only are these cars: unrealistic, unsafe, dangerous, and accident prone; but that they will be the descendent of humanity. Think about it, whenever you drive in a car with friends, family, or just

people in general; people are bonding, communicating, listening to music, or just looking out the window. With phones being extremely popular nowadays, we are slowly losing ourselves with the increase of these productions. Now with these cars, they will change everything. It's a downward fall from that, which is mainly why I am against the whole development of these machines.",4
056394c,"What is your opinion on smart cars? Would they help or just create future issues that were worse than before? I personaly support the current movement on smart cars. If the technology improves enough to cover all the current issues then I believe smart cars could really help alot. They would decrease accidents and allow people to use valuable time driving to do other things like learn or invent. Im standing in neutral ground though on weather they should be completely driverless unless they improve the smart cars in a way to make them completely safe.

To fully support smart cars and turn the publics opinion on supporting them I belive they need to create new laws that would clearly state whos resbonsible if an accident does accur. I think this because who would want to buy a car that you dont have to drive, but if the car does get into an accident your resbonsible! That would be a big problem and would creat problems between individuals and car manufacturers. The question being whos resbonsible?

Another thing they would have to improve would be their sensing technology. They would have to improve this because currently if their is an accident or detour they driver has to take over. If they want to make driverless cars then they should be driverless at all times. Would you agree? If the driver is being entertained and watching movies then suddenly after hours of watching movies he has to be completely focuse and in control of the vehicle wouldnt the person be a little tired and not completely focused? Im not totaly for sure how they could fix this problem, but im sure it will raise questions in the near future. Seeing how they want to push the people into supporting smart cars they would have to fix all issues and cover all the corners.

All of these small improvement would, in my opinion, turn the publics eyes into supporting smart cars. Getting the public to support smart cars would be one of the most important things to do if they want smart cars to be a success. If nobody supports them then all the work they are doing would be useless. Support would also put thme in a better financial spot. Having more money to put into smart cars would mean better and more improved research and development.

If all of the issues I brought up could be worked on and improved then, in my opinion, their would be no reasoning for people and myself for not supporting smart cars. Hopefully i'v coverd some of the current issues with smart cars and once their improved you will be like me and support the ever so growing idea of smart driverless vehicles.This is my opinion on smart cars. As long as they can continue to improve and come out with new ideas I fully support the movement on smart driverless automobiles!",4
056a4a4,"Everyone today believes that having a car is the best thing for them. Truthfully, it is not. Not having a car can prevent from polluting the earth and benifit us as people in a much better way. Not having a car will stop accidents, prevent deaths, and save you money.

In Vauban, many families now do not own cars. Heidrum Walter states ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car could actually make you a much happier person as well. You would'nt have to worry about spending too much money on gas or even getting into accidents. If you have to go somewhere far, you can just hop on a subway or pay for a taxi. I know, your probaly thinking: Paying for a taxi or paying for a subway ticket cost money but definately not nearly as much as having a car.

Next, without having to drive cars, our air we breath in will be much less polluted then it would be with cars. Paris evenually ended up on banning driving because the smog was so harsh to the environment. Anyone who drove cars were then fined. According to the article

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Congestion is car traffic so therefore, there was less smog in the air. In the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota , it states ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" Anyone who violated the rule was then fined a specific amount to stop the people from driving cars. Businessesman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air polution.""

Not owning a car can help you and your family become closer because you will have to walk places together, it will help you stay fit and it will benifit the companies because they will start to boom. In? source 4, Michael Sivak says ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" This means that more families are getting rid of their cars then they ever have before which will make the families closer. Walking everywhere will help you stay fit because your walking not sitting. Last but not least, companies will begin to boom. Source 3 states that ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks: rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic: and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" They are trying everything they can to make this world a better place. They are redoing a bunch of stuff just to show that they care. So lets show them that we care about our world too.

So lets think about the benifits of not having a car. You will be less stressed, you'll be in less accidents and you will save money. If I could have that decision I totally would take it. It is benifical for all of us so lets just live life healthy.       ????       ????       ?       ?    ",4
0571af0,"The world is advancing, technologies are being built, and the enviroment is changing. Imagine living in an area where there's a limited car usage. It might sound horrible but life goes on without cars. As to limiting your car usage it also has it's advantages. The advantages goes towards the people and the enviroment.

To start, everyone would know that the main reason is because of the state of our enviroment. There's a lot of pollution going out there in the world and it's not safe or natural. To give an example, according to the article, written by Elisabth Rosenthal, ""In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", passenger cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas and fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. To exemplify, greenhouse gases is one of the causes for the changes around the environment. They're not the good changes either. To support this, the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", written by Robert Duffer, shows an example of Paris and China banning car usages due to their high pollution and smogs. Robert Duffer states, ""Congestion was down sixty perent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In other words, polllution can hold a great affect of people trying to go to work, have fun, or even visit someone. Not only is change in the enviroment is bad but some people can just live without the use of transportation.

The continue to the advantages, the people get to spend their time with others more and even be happy just walking around. Going back to the article ""In German Suburb, life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer,? Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" To extend this, having a car would cause some people to be tense and stressed. Without the ability to do anything about it but just sit there or walk, it is much better to walk around with the people who's close. Another example would from the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selksy, another commentary made from a businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees with it. Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In other words, not only is the car-free day works for helping improve the enviroment, it's good for releasing stress for few people.

To conclude, letting go of driving around may sound like a disadvantage but it's actually an advantage to those around us. It's an advantage for both the enviroment and us. Who wouldn't want a stress-free enviroment?       ?    ",4
05aacdb,"The advantages of limiting car usage has errupted since the year 2005. America's love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car; they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday; maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air polution will decrese or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota's day without cars and Paris's driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.

As a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany's people has said a life without cars is wonderfull even if it takes a little more time to get places. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""(Rosenthal.3). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal's statistic Vauban's citizens are happy in this new way of life; they have learned that a life without cars can be different' but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.""Vauban's streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community""(Rosenthal.2). According to Elizabeth Rosenthal Vauban's streets being car free is a easier life; there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer.10). Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. ""On monday many motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day""(Duffer.11). Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.

As a result, to America's campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.    ",4

From the text, it has shown that nobody has the problem of going to venus for a study, just as the problem of coming back survived and healthy. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by seeing what people are capable of managing to do.

From studying Venus that can pursuit many resouces that are and could be presented in this project. NASA sees this as a processing challenge by having resources that could be processed. For an example, the text states ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."". By having a device that could help the danger and requirements, could solve the solution of the pressure in the atmosphere. If NASA is able to get to the planet, there will be many sources to be brought back for examination to study. For an example,""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."", the text has shown their are many types of feauture to be explored. The text also states,""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."", from this iy shows that if the resoucres come reasonable to use, it could increase the possibility.

From the study of venus it has shown knowing how it can increase the production of each challenge and resouce. It is possible to be completed with correct amount of studying . Studying impacts on how much you know of the project to process through all of the steps. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts by the challenges and resources being presented.",4
05cafcf,"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in schools is a great idea.

Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.

If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.

This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.

If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.

If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.

The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.

Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.

I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.

Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.

Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.

This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions everyday.

I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be exremely helpful.

The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emtions which is helpful because most people have trouble percieving facial traits and expressions.

If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

I think using the Facial Action Coding System software on our school computers is brilliant idea, and I personally think my peers would test it out in a heartbeat.

There are numerous benefits and positive outcomes from using this software in a classroom. ",4
05efbec,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author, Nick D'Alto explains how a recent technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" reveals human emotions in pictures. This is actually rather convincing to believe. How can you identify a picture's emotions through a new software? The use of the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" used to read facial emotional expressions is not valuable to students in classroom because it seems too expensive for a public school to use, it looks to be more useful at images, and video games.

""Facial Action Coding System"" is not useful to students in a classroom because it is expensive and mostly unaffordable for all classes. D'Alto explains what this technology is made up of, and its component looks expensive. On paragraph 3 the author explains that, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" (D'Alto 3) Having a 3-D model computer in classes not less than a hundred is money consuming and might ruin the school's budget. Having such prestige technology in class does not mean the students in the classroom will learn better or try changing their facial expressions.

Also, most of these type tehnologies are useful mainly at expensive images such as Mona Lisa portrait. This type of system only helps solve the mysteries behind old images such as Mona Lisa and not students' emotions. The author reveals that. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" (D'Alto 6) This shows that the Facial Action Coding System is mainly useful for such mystery portraits. It only helps solve people's curiosity rather than help students in classrooms.

Lastly the new technology also help make computer expressions more real in video games. Dr. Huang explains that, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive__ for video games or video surgery."" (D'Alto 6) This evidence shows that the new software is more valuable at helping video gemes to look more real than helping students to study harder or to succeed.

Lastly, the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" is not relevant for students in classroms because it is unaffordable, mainly useful for expensive portraits, and video games. There are many disadvantages than advantages for using the new technology at schools. The new system is more useful at video games and expensive portraits such as Mona Lisa's than in schools.",4

Driverless cars can be more fuel effecent than the cars we drive today. As the text says,"" He envisions a future with public transprotation system where fleets of driverless cars from a public-transport taxi systam. The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than the bus."" This quote from the text tells us that if we switched over compleatly to driverless cars we would use half of the fuel we use today. Driverless cars would help the world be a cleaner place.

Cars that can drive themselves can also be alot safer for the people traveling inside them and for the people around them. Smart cars will sense the world around them, and they can help make things like trafic jams and road blocks safer for everyone involved. As the text states, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should take over. Other options under consederation are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads up dispalys. Manufacturers are also consiering useing cameras to watch that drivers are remaning focused on the road. While the driver watches the road. the car watches the driver."" This quote from the text tells us that the smart cars will alart us when danger is ahead so that we will be prepared. This will help prevent colisions with other cars and pedestions. The driverless car with help make the world a safer place.

The driverless car will give the pasangers in the car a more enjoyable ride. The pasangers will not have to deal with the stress of the road. Allthough the driver will still have to be paying attention o the road, he or she could relax knowing that they are in the hands of a smart driverless car. In the text it says,""We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way."" This quote is saying that the driverless cars will be a fun alternative to the manual cars we drive today. The new smart cars will be a relaxing and fun car for the future.

The driverless car has many positive facters, but it also has a few negative facters. There is the posabitaly that the car can malfuction, or not sense an accident. There are manny varables in the new and evolving world. But man kind can never experances the true joys of life without trial and error. The driverless car will take time to perfect, but when it is complete it will be a masterpice.

Smart driverless cars are the future. They can provide safety like cars today can not. They are also a more fuel effecent way of transportation. And lastly, driverless cars will creat a more relaxed and fun emviroment inside the car. Driverless cars are better in many ways to what we drive today, and will provide a saffer emviroment for the future.",4
06235e1,"Technology is one of the fastest industrys growing rapidly in our generation. There are well over 100 ads on television that ties to better technology. These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",4
0639535,"We should not keep the Electoral college because; first, it's unfair, and also, it can quickly turn into a disater.

To begin with, the Electoral college is an unfair system. In

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , "" Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.""[Plumer, p10].When voters vote for the Electoral college the person they put in might not even vote for who the people want for the President. The system is not only unfair when people vote, also when campagins happen in states. In paragraph 13 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , the author states ""Because of the winner-takes-all system... candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."". With this system, we have some states that are left out of the campaign of candidates going through states, because they are not important to the candidate for winning.

In addition, not only is the Electoral college unfair, the system can fail at any given election. Plumer wrote in paragraph 11 ""...what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress."" the Electoral college is only to have one slate of electors from each state. With two slates from one state it would give both the state and the candidate an advantage over the rest of the states and the other candidate, that would turn into a disater. Not only can the states destory the Electoral college system, the system can destory itself.? Included in paragraph 12, "" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."". Even the people put into the college can ruin themselves by one or two electoral voters changing their minds.

Not everything about the Electoral college is bad. The article

In the Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our reasons despised method of choosing the President said, ""..it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.""[Posner, p18]. Even the other vote systems are strongly disliked. The Electoral system is not the most disliked system but it can also get the President everyone wants. In paragraph 19,""... a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."". A candidate for the president can't focus on one region, because it will make other states feel that they are not important.

Finally, the Electoral college should no longer exist because, it's an unfair system and can quickly turn into a catastrophe.    ",4
0640912,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. The idea of automatic cars has been around for a long time. Technology was not as advanced as it is now. Improvements in computer software is going to help make driving safer and is leading to cars that can handle more difficult tasks on their own.

Having driverless cars is a great idea. There are a lot of benifits of having driverless cars. In paragraph 1 it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world"". Having driverless cars would lower the number of deaths and crashes. Imagine someone being drunk and wanting to drive home. Having a driverless car would help that situation a lot less dangerous.

There are a lot of negative things about driverless cars. Having one of these cars would still require attention and assistance. In paragraph 7 it states, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. The necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs"". If someone is drunk or on drugs how will they know when a problem occurs? Not everyone is going to be fit to have a driverless car.

There are a lot of things a driverless car can do much better than a human can do. In paragraph 7 it states, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph...They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."". If a person is unable to break fastly the car will do it. Having a automatic car can help the person worry less because the car will help get them to their destination safely and hopefully on time. Maufacturers are also going to consider using cameras to watch the drivers and make sure they are focused on the road. An automatic car would be good in a situation if someone gets a phone call or a text message. Even though they are supposed to be watching road it will still make it less dangerous. In paragraph 8 it says, ""..Something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"".

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. There are more positive things about a driverless car than negative. Some say why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW manager driver states, "" We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way"". The idea of driverless cars will further be an idea and the negatives will be improved. Maybe one day there will be a true driverless car.      ",4
0644f5b,"Studdies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France baned Driving do to smog. Sounds Extream, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely ""

Car-Free

"". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an aditional $40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of Vauban's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA (

Environmental Protection Agency

) is promoting ""

car reduced

"" communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a car-free day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they baned driveing all togather. France desided that they where going to order even-numbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Same for odd-numbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and car-free campains have helped our environment. These countried have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to partisipate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause.

065c240,"Outer space is a mystery within itself, but the addition of the planets and stars are just an expansion to those mysteries. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" was written for readers to understand how a planet that may be different in design can be the most important reason as to why it should be taken a look at. The author compares and contrasts Venus with Earth and Mars to emphasize what Venus has to offer. Venus may not be the easiest task to complete, but that should encourage people to push the exploration of the planet.

Venus may have a variation of attributes compared to Earth and Mars, but that shouldn't stop people from exploring the planet. Since Earth and Venus are considered ""twins,"" they are similar according to their, ""...density and size, and occasionally their distance too."" (2) The author also mentions how Venus could have once been the, ""...most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" With that being said, if Venus was similar to Earth in its lifetime, then it could answer pondering questions like ""Is there any other signs of life on other planets?"" Just like Earth, Venus has, ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" (4) Venus' similar characteristics to Earth makes it an interesting mission for scientists.

Sending man to the moon wasn't the easiest trip, but it got done. So, why shouldn't Venus be explored too? Venus is said to have, ""...hostile conditions on the surface,"" (5) and it is considered, ""inhospitable."" (4) Both phrases do not appear to be the most promising when deciding if landing on Venus is the best choice, but beyond those risks could be life changing discoveries. This mission is impossible because humans are able to make, ""machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully.""

Traveling to Venus doesn't have to be the most difficult plan. Space travel already is a timely mission, but Venus is said to, ""...sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" If Venus is a close visit, then scientists should be even more compelled to search the planet. Scientist have come up with smart ideas to observe Venus like, ""a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape."" (5) With this the vehicle is close enough to explore without humans dying or the vehicle frying. The heat is dangerous, but scientists could obtain important information they've been wanting to find out.

The author informs readers on the risks of traveling to Venus. Venus is not the safest place to be close to, but dangers have never stopped people from making trips into space in the past. Venus provides many opportunities that people have to be willing to take and learn from. Danger is nothing new to society, so traveling to Venus is only the newest obstacle to bypass. ",4
06673c8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" the author states how our technology is increasing so much today, that soon we will see cars that drive themselves. The author states some negative sides to the story, and some positive. But I think that driverless cars will help our country in many different ways, and I support it.

According to the author, he says will we even be able to make new cars because there are laws that do not allow some states to test them. According to the article, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars""(9). I think car manufacturers can test their cars in a factory in some states that it is legal to do it in, and once they prove that it is safe I believe that some states will uplift the laws that they have on self driving cars.

Also many people ask, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?the driver or the manufacturer""(9)? This is one of the main concerns of people today, but I would believe it would be the manufacturers fault since they were the ones who made the car, and designed all the parts of it. Humans should have no worry about liability for themselves because the car manufacturers should cover all the expenses that happened in the accident since they were the ones who designed the cars.

Another benifit to self driving cars is that they also would reduce half the fuel that humans use today. Accorting to the text it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today?s taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world""(1). Not using half the amount of fuel today is super benificial for the enviornment since we are not polluting it nearly as much. Many people would support this because we would be help save the enviornment, and also we would not have to spend nearly as much money on gas as we normally do. Another benift is how all the cars would be safe. According to BMW,""Safety is a big concern""(8). Clearly BMW would not release the car if it was not safe, but if our country all switches to self driving cars then this will reduce the crashes, and accidents by a ton, which would be saving many lives.

Many automakers are working on developing new safety gadgets for cars, and also a couple of the automakers have alrady developed a self driving car. Tesla for example, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time""(10). Tesla has projected that they will release a car in 2016 that 90% of the time is on autopilot. That is this year, and when they release it all the other automakers are going to try and design a better self driving car than the tesla which could make the other manufacturers come out with a new self driving car soon also. Some other automakers have said, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"" (10). This is crazy so by the time 2020 at least three more auto makers predict that they will have self driving cars also. By the 2020s we should expect my self drivin cars that will be on the road.

In conclusion there are many positives/ benifits that will come out of this self driving car. Though there are some set backs that some states/ automakers will have to over come. In the end outcome it will help drivers safety, and it will help the enviornment. In the overall outcome that is why we should have self driving automobiles.    ",4
0674a38,"Driverless cars would not be a smart step forward for us as Americans. Considering the fact the car can not fully function on its own it would be very difficult to deal with. If the car has to ask the driver to take over everytime it can't handle a certain situation, then make one that can and then we can advance into the new era of driverless cars.

The fact that Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver, says people would get bored behind the weel of a car controlling itself proves that people would lose focus and that may cause fatalities. When they lose focus because the car is in control and look at their phone, the car may ask them to take over on the drop of a dime, and the driver may panick. Especially if there is an oncoming car and the driverless car can not react fast enough, because it only takes a split second.

Another point I would like to make is when big name companies such as Google market anything they sell simply because of who makes it. If there is a flaw in a cars system then they would be risking a lot of peoples lives, in terms of who buys them. In paragraph eight, it reads that "" Upgrading to existing roads would be too expensive to be practical."" and that means if there is a flaw under the hood, they would lose a lot of money from a bunch or attackers, manufacturers, and their own industry crumbling.

All in all, I believe that it would not be a good way to advance in technology if we're practically selling prototypes. People would be buying driverless cars that aren't state of the art because either it was too pricy or the car itself can not handle the surprises driving may consist of and it would be a major fail on a lot of people's behalf. If we had cars that could fully function safely and accurately on the street, then we could maybe experiment on making the future present. But for now, let us work ot the kinks of the products that affiliate with people's everyday lives or even their lives period.",4

069cd67,"An idea for driverless cars does sound appealing. It can improve the intelligence of today's cars by giving them a mind of their own. However, these cars may seem like a decent idea for the future, but they can prove to be really difficult. Quite a few problems can arise from this phenomenon. The development for these driverless cars should cease pretty soon.

In the future, driverless cars are supposed to become a new thing. These cars will have the ability to function on their own and drive itself, which will not really require the driver to handle it. Although this seems like a nice thought, this is quite an issue already. Creating driverless cars can create laziness in lots of people. Assuming that this creation is titled 'driverless', many people will think that they do not have to do anything. This will raise the laziness in some people if this driverless car becomes available. This invention is not a good idea.

As well as it can raise laziness in people, it can quite possibly cause the driver to use it to his/her advantage in inappropriate ways. There is a law that says the driver must be held responsible for any mistakes he/she makes while on the road whether the car is automated or not. The driver will be at fault regardless if any acident is to happen. Even though this law exists, people will still make excuses for their mistakes. If an accident occurs, the driver may use the car as an excuse to avoid any responsibilities, such as court cases if anything is damaged. With such an invention as great as this, someone is most likely going to use it as a scapegoat for their mishaps. This just gives people a reason to avoid being guilty for what they did.

It is said that the car is supposed to maintain its commands and make driving easier. These driverless cars are supposed to work almost efficiently for everyone. However, accidents are still likely to happen. Even if these cars are supposed to work well, things can go wrong. Perhaps the car may somehow malfunction while on the road. If this happens, it will put the driver and other people on the road, driving or walking, at an extreme risk. If a malfunction in the car is to occur, accident and death rates will increase. This is extremely unsafe for drivers in the future.

It sounds great to have a car that can drive itself in the future. Maybe it might raise the intelligence of some drivers. Nevertheless, the possibilities of this new car going wrong should not be ignored. These cars cannot be 100% perfect at all times after its release. It can be unsafe and extremely inaccurate and should not become an invention in the future.",4

There is a main thoroughfare , where the tram runs to downtown Freiburg, and and a ffew streets on the edge of the community but ther e are only two places to park-large garadges on the outside of town. And it cost 40,000 dollars along witha home. If we had cities like this here in the U.S. it would be so much better and there wouldnt be so much pollution.

By limiting the usage on cars it will help save money. Think if you walked or rode you're bike to work everyday then you wouldnt have to pay for gas. Gas is tipically three to four dollars so if you wanted to put thirty gallons of gas in you car it could cost you ninety dollars. Thats a lot of money to spend on gas and thats not even a full tank for some people. Sure if you ride you bike to work everyday you might have to fix it but you're gonna have to fix your car at some point to and bike parts are so much cheaper than car parts so you'd be saving money there too. And if you walked you would'mt have to even worry about fixing your bike. It might take you longer to get to where you need to go but think you'll be saving money and the Earth. You don't even have to ride your bike or walk, you can car pool or take the bus. You still have to pay for the bus but its way cheaper than paying for gas.

If you're limiting your car usage and walking or riding your bike to work everyday, which maens you'll be getting exercise. Most people don't get the exercise they need so by limiting your car usage not only are you helping the environment you're getting the daily exercise you need. Even if you're riding the bus you're gonna have to get to the bus stop some how. And they even have a place to put your bike on the bus so if the bus does'tn take you all the way to where you need to go you can ride your bike the rest of the way.

So limiting your car usage is'nt all that bad. I mean I don't know anyone who does'nt want to help eliminate green house gases, save money and get exercise while doing it.    ",4

Do you like to help people in need then you should join the seagoing cowboys. Lots of people need help ,they need food supplies ,animals and many other things. You will also be having lots of fun and you will be able to enjoy yourself.

There are lots of other place to see and different foods. If you join now you will see different cities,countries and foods. There are lots of diffent types of food to try and maybe you might really like one type of food. Cities are diiferent from other ones they may be alike but not really. There are different types of cities to see . Countrys are way different nthan other ones and some other ones speak a different langue. Don't you think it would be great if you to lean a different langue?

When you would come back to your home you would be ale to teach others different cultires and lanuges.

Helping others is a great thing to do and very inportant. There are lots of people without food or cloths to wear. People need help because their towns have been destroyed and they have nothing left for them. They also need animals to perduse meat, wool, and they can sell htem so they can get money to buy things. Lots of those people are dieing from hunger or they are out side with no place to sleep or even sit. They need our help,they need your help.

You might be think how am I going to get there. We will take you by boat but you might be wondering that seems boring and we will have nothing to do on the boat. There is lots of things to do on the boat. You can feed the animals as we take to different places. Does that seem boring to you if so you are right but there are othering things to do such as baseball and volleyball games and other games. On the back that is when you can really start having fun. SInce there are no animals on the boat that extra space can be use as a table-tennis room and you can have tournamets. You can also have fencing,boxing,reading, whittling.

Do you still think you will not like being Seagoing CowBoys? There are many different food,cities,and countires. Helping the people in the need who dont't have food suplies and animals. Also all those fun games you would be able to play and how you would be able to make new friends and talk to different people. That seems like a great program i would join and i have joined the Seagoing CowBoys. To see different things,to help lots of people ,and to meet different people and have a good time with them. I don't know about you but I sure would want to be a part of the Seagoing Cowboys. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys program you would have a great time.         ",4
071de41,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" a technology called Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies. This would allow people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another. Being able to know how someone feels helps to complement those emotions. If a classmate was feeling happy, sad, angry, or any other emotion, and it was known it would be much easier to know how to approach them than it would be without the knowledge showing why this infromation could be valuable.

Knowing how another person feels makes it less difficult to communicate with them and communication is important in a classroom. In the text the author talked about how the program could tell when a person is not truly conveying emotions.

The text says,""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

This information is useful to a classroom because it shows the true emotions or feelings of someone. If a student in a classroom said ""I understand"", but did not truely mean it a teacher could use this information to know that more teaching may have to be done for students to fully understand the topic being taught.

Another example from the text says,""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This quote from the text explains that there are many different ways to express emotion and because of this it may be harder for everyone to fully understand how someone feels based on facial expression. That is why this technology could be valuable so that everyone is fully understood and proper treatment can be given to complement emotions.

Things should change in a classroom when students feel unconnected to what is going on, but it is not easy for everyone to know just when students may feel out of place. A quote from the text says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Here in the text the article talks about the technology being able to tell when a student is bored and confused, and then being able to modify a lesson effectively.

With this technology students would gain a full understanding of a topic without needing to ask because of facial expressions. This would be very effective in a classroom as it makes sure that everyone gets to learn the way that they need to.

The text also says,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too."" This quote explains that not all communication is verbal and most is actually nonverbal.

This means that listening may not always be enough and it is important to see and feel how others feel proving why this technology can help a classroom.

By reading faces the technology can help convey one's feelings to another to help gain a full understanding.

By understanding how someone else feels it makes it easier to understand them.

The article says,""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

This quote talks about empathy and how it is important in knowing how to treat people. Using this in a classroom could helpl classmates and teachers get along better.

The use of facial recognition technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies.

This helps people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another.

It is important in a classroom to know eachothers feelings and can be valuable.",4
0728321,"The Aliens on Mars

In the text Unmasking the Face on Mars NASA says that there was a face.Then they went back eighteen years later.Then another three years and said it was a natural landform.I also think that it is a natural landform because there isn't really aliens or anything other living thing on mars.Some people would there are lifeforms on Mars because of water which is ridiculous.There could be clouds and water on a planet without a lifeform. In these next few paragraphs i will tell you why it is a natural landform.

One reason that the so called face is only a landform is because it could've been a rock formation.There could be rocks in the shape of a head because of other rocks and erosion.And how the got the eyes?...shadows.Shadows could've been a be part of this because its a planet pretty close to the sun.So from which way the Viking 1 was facing there could've been shadows.

Second reason is on April 5,1998 when they went to mars again with Mars Global Surveyor...while thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting the image JPL wedsite revealed it as a natural landform. People were upset so they said since it was a cloudy haze there could still be a face.Which made it worse because people actually believed that.

Third reason is if there was a face form on earth and no one would freak out by it because there is actual humans on earth.So if there were aliens everyone would freak.Am I right?So if there were real aliens you wouldnt know what they actually look like but you do know from evidence from ""actual pictures"" that people supposedly took.

Some people think its the other way around.Some people who aren't like me actually believe in aliens.They think since in 2001 they sent a better camera on a ""cloudless"" day that there were Martians.And since they have the camera whith better pixels they could see more clearly...so clearly that you could've have seen Egyptian style pyramids or even a small shack which was almost impossible in the Viking 1.

To conclude, I think that the face was a natural landform made by erosion.It would most likely to be impossible for it to be a martian, not saying it is but I highly doubt there would be martians.",4
073d5b0,"""New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others."" I believe that this software is very interesting because it detects your facial expressions through a screen and tries to understand your emotions. However, I do not think that we need this software in our schools for education purposes.

There are a few reasons in which I believe that these programs should not be installed on our school computers. The text claims that ""the computer could modify a lesson, like a human instructor.""

However, I find this hard to believe considering the software can not specifically determine what lessons or problems you do not understand. One for instance, if a student is supposedly confused or bored, he or she can ask the teacher for help. If we have a school computer that modifies and changes the lesson due to facial expressions, it might get in the way and misunderstand what we actually need help with or slow us down. Recieving specific help from teachers, to understand the certain steps that a student struggles with would be a better option in my opinion.

Secondly, we do not know how accurate this software is. The program could be very touchy; It could mix up confusion for anger. The student could be upset about a different topic or could simply have a certain resting face. The accuracy could have a lot to do with how this program would help us.

Lastly, Why spend a lot of money installing programs to hundreds of computers at our school when we can recieve help from our teachers?

Teachers are there to answer specific questions and a software that only detects your facial expressions and matches them to emotions can not do that. Installing these programs to our school computers will cost the school a lot of time and money without knowing for a fact that this software will actually be useful. Given these ideas, I do not think that it would be a very helpful addition to our students to install this software.                           ",4
074fd98,"Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. They are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest way to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not emmiting from your body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will nt only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost non-exsistent if we were to gert rid of motherized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The way the Germans started to remove cars from the road is by removing parkig lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and they are so inconvient.

Any doctor in the world no matter how young, or where they live will tell their patients that exercise is the only way to stay healthy, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting from one place to another will require another means fr transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride your bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the enviorment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone layer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesnt take fuel. Just good old man power. It's tradgic in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue."" this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.

In the four articles they all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is because there are more negatives to the industrialiaztion of a car rather than just going back to the way our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our vary own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile.

0760f30,"In today's world, technology is everywhere. Technology helps assist in everyday tasks and brings about new levels of creativity. In this new age of innovation, smart cars fit right in with all other aspects of our digitalized lives. Not only could driverless cars help in many other ways regular cars can't, but they also allow for an increase in safety potential. Overall, driverless cars will be beneficial for the modern world.

The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. By using driverless cars as a taxi system, gas consumption would majorly decrease. The taxi system idea could also lead to new ways of public transportation. These cars could take their passengers anywhere they needed to go through a direct route. Passengers would no longer have to wait for long periods of time on buses for their stops. These driverless systems would allow for greater flexibility overall.

Driverless cars would also help communities everywhere with safety. Since these smart cars are loaded with sensor technology, they can help limit the amount of crashes that were regularly happening. The protypes of driverless cars have gone millions of miles without crashes and could help stunt the commonality of vehicular crashes and deaths. Driverless cars could also aide with the safety for learning and elderly drivers. Oftentimes, teenage drivers and drivers with slow reaction times are the causes of accidents that could have been avoided with easy assistance. Smart, semi-driverless cars could be the answer to these costly problems.

Ultimately, driverless cars would have an extreme influence on today's society. The assistance from technology has changed the world we live in and will continue to do so. Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world. ",4
078120d,"The author makes a very strong statement when he says we should explore Venus. The author finds the exploration to be worthy of NASAs time. As dangerous as it may be, exploring Venus would determine whether or not it could be a new home for the human race and all other sources of life. It would be a significant breakthrough for survival.

When the author says that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, it sounds like Venus should be our next home. It is not that easy as the author exlplains. Many times NASA has sent spacecrafts to Venus to see what it had to offer. Most crafts became worthless after a short period of time on the planet. Not one spacecraft has landed on Venus in over thirty years. Zero research was able to be done due to the extremes of the planet.

The planet Venus is closer to the sun than Earth resulting in extreme temperatures around 800 degrees on the outer crust of the planet. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide cover Venus along with clouds made of sulfuric acid. The atmospheric pressure is also an insane extreme scaling in around ninety times that of Earth. Volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning are all challenges that come along with Venus as well.

NASA has figured out ideas to send a man to study Venus. Though he would be floating 30 miles up from the surface, we would gather more information than we have at the time. MASA is also trying to engineer a spacecraft that will be able to land on the plnaet and last as long as they need or want.

Overall the author shows the strive to gather information on Venus and how it is setting us further in the future than never before. Venus is very dangerous indeed but new ideas and theories are being made everyday trying to conquer what Venus has brought to the table. The author summarizes this as, ""Our travels on Earth any beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",4
07845e1,"What do you think the face on Mars is? A natural landform or made by aliens? Most people think the so called ""Face on Mars"" is formed by aliens. I believe otherwise because, landforms on Earth are like that and these assumptions are made by conspircy theorist not by NASA officals. now here are my reasons.

The face on Mars is made by natural landforms and not by aliens. One thing of evience by a picture by Mars Global Surveyor, in paragraph 7 it says ""...anxious web surfers we're waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" That's a big piece of evidence that it's not made by aliens. Also, my second piece of evience that supports that the face on Mars is not made by aliens in paragraph 12 is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the Amerian West"". ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That's my first reason I believe that the face on Mars is landform made.

The fact that conspriacy theorist make the assumption of the face on Mars is made by aliens. You have to understand that those remakes are not all true they are just theories which is just provided by evience but, not always right. In paragraph 5 it says ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of like on Mars-evidencd that NASA woud rather hide, say conspiracy theroists."" ""meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" That evidence was never what NASA said that's conpiracy theorist said and it's not true. So, mark these words and think about your decision, i think you should change you're mind about the alien theory to a natural landform with this information.

The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" from the evidence is that it's a landfrom instead of aliens making these faces on Mars. Don't always go by what the internet or media says, go by what real experts say. Maybe, you people that think that it's made by aliens I hope my reasonings and evidence is strong enough to change you're mind. Now what do you think of my evidence did it change your mind?             ",4
0785120,"Just imagine being able to go places without driving. If it was really possible to make driverlesscars, they would be a success. The development of these cars are already coming into a positive position. But also these cars do have some safety risks as well.

Driverless cars can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. What if you have a baby in the car, or perhaps a pregnant woman in labor? These features can help the driver get tasks done while in the car, and still be moving safely as well.

People may ask what if you get bored and fall asleep since your not driving? All models of driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads-up displays. Also GM has devoped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedrstrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acheived with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written to the asumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. But new laws will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident. If something fails and someone is injures, is it the diver or the manufacturers fault?

Driverless cars are coming into a positive postiton. They can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. That can help drivers at anytime when they are occupying the vehicle. All models are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. The key to a truley driverless car is ahead of us, be we are getting closer, and closer to the destination every day.       ",4
078c66d,"With the advancement in technology in the world we live in today, there should be no surprise of a car with the capabilities to drive itself. Though it does give technology yet another human job, driverless cars should be manufactored. I do not believe they should be maufactored for the average person though. Driverless cars should be manufactored for the blind, elderly, or anybody who does not have the driving capabilities that most have.

Driverless cars should be manufactored for the elderly. Very few people above the age of 70 have the driving capabilites and safety they once did when they were younger. For this reason, a driverless car would be ideal and safe for them to use for transportation. The driverless car would be a safe and effective transportation method for the elderly, this is one reason why driverless car should be manufactored.

Another reason the driverless car should be manufactored is how it will help the fight against drunk driving. With the computer at the wheel, and not the drunk driver, this could prevent from an accident or even a death. Though they could take control of the wheel, the computer system could be capable of recognizing such danger with the sensors, and take over for safety. The driverless car would be good to develop so that it could help in the fight against drunk drivers and other intoxicated drivers.

My final reason that the driverless car should be developed is so that the handicapped could have an easier time with transportation. The blind, the wounded, and the deaf all have their diffuculties with transportation. With the advancement in technology and cars, this would make it easier for them to get from one place to another. With the technology driving for them, they won't have to worry about there disability affecting them. With a safe driverless car developed, the handicapped community would get a better way of transportation.

In conclusion, technology is not always meant for fun. When the technology can greatly improve the life of the eldery or handicapped, it should be developed or used. When the technology can keep other drivers on the road safe from intoxicated driving, it should be developed and used. The driverless car can do all of the above, which is why it should be developed and used.     ",4
079b107,"Some of the advantages of limiting car usage is definitely that it would help not polute the air. With so many people driving cars in small towns that can quickly polute the air, especially in paris in source two where it says ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partail driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" With all of that pollution it can cause things such as global warming, and unhealthy air for our bodies. With just a small break of not driving the congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of france, after five days of intensifying smog. Also with cold nights and warm days that also causes air to trap car emissions.

Another advantage of not driving cars, would be exercise. That would be such a good work out because you would have no other option except to walk/ride your bikes. You would get to socialize with everyone else who is walking to their jobs, or the grocerey store all while getting a little bit of exercise with your family. With everyone walking and having nothing better to do, sports centers and parks activity has bloomed throughough the city, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up with sales.

More and more people have stopped getting cars/licenses and instead taking the city bus, walking or riding their bike. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If more people would continue to either car pool or find a different way to get where they're going the worlds pollution would definitely begin to go down. Without all of the pollution that comes out of cars and that gets trap into the air, our air would begin to get so much more cleaner and safer for us to breathe.

With all of the money it takes to repair the roads, and the electricity it takes to run all of the stop lights, that money could go towards other things if people didnt drive as much as they do. Although many people need and use their cars for transportation theres always other ways to getting around town. It would also help save you money that is spent on gas every week, with the gas prices being unpredicatable every day.

With all of these advantages of not driving cars as much or at all, it would really help protect the worlds air, and could be a great source of exercise! Walking or riding your bike to wherever you need to go, or even just taking the city bus for two dollars. Also saving your money and spendind it on something else rather than wasting it on gas, or getting your car fixed. Or simply even buying a car, which can cost thousands of dollars.    ",4
07a82b9,"Do you ever wonder how it would be if we lived in a car free enviroment where cars where limited. There would not be any traffic jams,or heavy smog,people wont have to worry about gas prices. Our enviroment would be cleaner and better for us to live in. There are so many advantages from limiting car usage.

People with cars tend to worry about gas prices and how much money it takes to fill up their car. When limiting the usage of cars,and walk or bike it helps save your money for something other than gas. Just think of it the average person has to fill up their gas tank at least once every one to two weeks, and if they drive constantly then once every three to five days after they had just filled up their tank. Why even waste gas to go down the street to a store or to a friends when you can use a better and more conservitive type of transportation, its nonsensicle to even drive for a short amount of time if you can walk or bike to you destination. If we also limit car usage we wont have to worry much about bumper to bumper traffic or car accidents. Think of how much much time traffic on the highways wastes sometimes 20 minutes to an hour or two when we can be doing something better with our lives. Not to mention if we limited our usage our roads sidewalks and highways would all change. There would also be more outside attractions to do and be apart of, malls and stores would be different as well considering that if not much cars are around its not necassary to have shopping plaza because not much cars would be parked. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot and change and impact the way we live in a positive way.

Think of our enviroment and ozone for a minute,and how bad the fules that power our cars effect it, not only does the fules effect our enviroment it also affects us too. When we have a high amount of smog in the air due to cars it makes people congested because our air is tainted and polluted. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid the EPA is promoting the act of reduced car communities. Its not just cars either you have motorcycles as well that harm us and the enviroment ion the same way. Not only will limiting your usage on your car will be better for your wallet it would be better for you as well considering the fact that some people if not using or having a car tend to walk or bike which is exercise and it helps to benifit you out as well as your money. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot. Considering that everyone is out of shape because of our advances in life a little walking or biking exercise will benifit us from being lazy, you can even make your walk fun with music to listen to. If we limit our usage it will help our enviroment and our health as people as well.

Cars maybe needed if you have a job or a place that you need to go that is a far stretch from where you are. Cars are very handy i'll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things. People are just lazy and depend on cars so they dont have to walk, take a bus ,or bike to their destination but its that mind set that most of us have and thats why our enviroment is getting killed slowly. We need to stop being lazy and think of better ways to get back and forth from certain areas.

Cars can are good to have for self transportation, but there are much better ways to get from place to place without hurting your wallet and your enviroment. There are plenty of benifits from limiting car usage for everyone. When we limit car usage we dont have to worry about gas prices or smog in our enviroment or anything of that nature. Limiting gas makes us better and healthier because we are finding more physical alternative ways for transportation.    ",4
07b76d3,"I believe that we should not have driverless cars. I dont think that driverless cars are needed. Yes, it is cool and fun to have but, its not always about having fun; safety comes first. There are lots of problem that can occur with these cars such as, they can malfunction, people might have to learn how to drive again considering the fact that these cars will be handled differently and there will be problems with safety. If an accident were to happen, who would be at fault? Can we actually blame the car?

Driverless cars can be very dangerous. If these cars are not built the correct way, they could malfunction and put somones life at risk. Although the cars are tested multipule times, they will never be perfect. Just think about all the new Iphones or other devices that have been upgraded; they still have problems and things that people would like to be improved.

Another reason why I am against driverless cars is because people might have to learn how to drive again. Depending on how the smart cars are made, people might have to go through driving test similar to if u wanted your motorcycle license. There will be lots of new technology, responsibilites, rules, and regulations that come with the smart car. Do ur really think people would want to go through all of those test just to get another car?

The last reason why I disagree with the smart cars is beacuse of safety. The smart car can become a huge safety hazard. In paragragh nine is says,"" Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver control at all times."" This quote shows that the law believes it's safer to have a human in control. It also says,""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This quote explains my biggest consern. If someone or a feamily was severly hurt who would be to blame? Although the car was driving, the driver should be focused at all times no matter what because anything could go wrong within a matter of seconds. Would you really want to put ur family at risk?

I disagree with driverless cars. Driverless cars are very dangerous excpecially of they are not in the right hands. They can malfunction, we could have problems with people not wanting to take all the test just to get a new car, and they put lives at risk. To have a driverless car, you need to be responsible, and mature. Although its fun, it is also risky. Don't put your life or anyones elses life at risk. ",4
07c48b4,"How would I feel about being able to detect somone else's feelings? I honestly believe that it would be helpful to understand someone and what they are going through at that specific time.

My first thought on this opinion is that it must of took a while to actually build this and to think of the idea as to what you could use to figure it all out. When Dr. Paul Eckman built this he must of had to be thinking about other people and the concept of wanting to help others. In pargraph four it proclaims ""By weighing hte differnt units, the software can identitfy mixed emotions"". Dr. Eckman was on the right track building this because any human being can feel up to 3 emotions at once and he knew just that so he figured he would build it be able to detect not just one but mulitple.

In pargraph 5 it says ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial triat that conveys it"". By the arthour of this article I feel like he knows the cainf anf genorosity of being there and helping a friend. This being made is awesome because I don't know about you but most of the times i'm down or angery I don't like to tell people why or event talk about it being I will get even more upset no matter the size of the issue. The FACS is just the answer for helping a friend in need when you know they need the comfort but don't want to say anything.

There is so many good things about this new software that only genius could of thought of. A drama coach once made his kids practice making happy and sad faces due to actually feeling the emotions before they went on to a play. Placed before me in paragraph 9 ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" Did you know that actually listeing to you friends or parents when they say ""put on a happy face"" it may help. Study shows that this actually can make you happy and being happy is more of what we need in this world.

I highly agree with this article and give it a 10/10 considering it is a very kind think to do and not to mention a brillant idea. All the emotions it can detect right down to the percent in unbelieveable. It can take us far ways and may even make the world a better place. Being happy is the number onekey to a great life and everyone deserves that.   ",4
07c7556,"I belive that the development of driverless cars should be continued because they help those who are unaware of whats happening by giving them warnings and automatically stoping on their own.

Driverless cars would be agreat thing for us and even though you have to manually on your own, back in and out of the parking lot or deal with traffic issues, thats still just a small simple task. Lately Google has a modified a car named the Toyota Prius. This car has position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video mounted camera near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. The most important thing about this car, is that it has a Dubbed LIDAR, which uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. These appliances to a car are very helpful for the driver. It allows them to see whats behind them, sensors that lets the car no when something is coming, and it checks the cars surroundings.

Technology has been producing more and more ways for us to have driverless cars. So far, cars aren't completly driverless yet, but they can steer, accelerate, and brake all by themselves. They are all designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. So, humans still have to be alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires them. GM has developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Maufactors are considering adding cameras to watch that drivers are focused on the road. While the driver

watches the road, the car watches the driver,

There are still laws that human driver must be in control at all times. if there are to be an continuation of driverless cars, they will have to make new laws so that they can cover liability.

So driverless cars are still continuing on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Many car companies are planning new things for ther future, like Tesla has a projected in 2016 they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time, and Mercedes- Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that drive themselves by 2020. So, the road to truly driverless cars continues on, and we grow closer and closer to our goal every day for the new age of cars.",4
07ca280,"Dear  State Senator, 1/23/15

I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a

""winner- take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate."" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.

My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is becuase it is a ""disaster factor"", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?

In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or  causes many disruptions in our country.

Sincerly, a very patriotic citizen,

07cd836,"One uses a car to go to the store, pick someone up, or even to go shopping, but what if people had no cars? Not having a car would have advantages.

To start with, not having a car helps the enviroment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in th eUnited Stated."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 5). Without cars the air will become cleaner and people won't have all the polution in the air. Our air will get better if we start not having cars.

Also, another advantage is that people will get healthier. No polution gives people healthier air and with no cars people will have to walk everywhere or bike. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular swuare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are bing adopted around the world in attempts to make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to the public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, parragraph 6). Ones destination will be a walk away not miles. People will just walk, bike, and if their destination is far away one will take public transportaion. One will become more active without cars.

Finally, driving is comming to an end. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the Untied States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (The end of car culture, paragraph 29). Gas cost more, people are getting hurt while texting and driving, and some people just don't know how to drive. People seem to be getting over cars. This could help the enviroment. Driving just isn't a priority.

In conclusion, having no more cars would benifit people. The enviroment will be better and people are getting over cars anyways. Why drive a car that harms the air, when one could simpily walk or ride a bike making one healthier too? Not having cars would help.    ",4
07cde52,"My argument for the development of these cars is against it because i do not agree with some stuff such as the cars driving its self.

If a car drives it's self then it would be no fun for people who have cars. This development is crazy because it will change many things. We should keep cars the way they are instead of changing them to something different that not everyone would like.

Many cars are already having many problems so why make a car that can drive its self? We should fix the problems in todays cars instead of worrying about trying to bring something new. People are putting to much in cars, such as sensors and computer hardware. These things might help but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, but not everything can be sure to always work. Anything can fail at anytime.

Technology is really advanced! Everyday people are working on something new because of how well technology is. If technology keeps on advanving people will make more things and come out with incredible things. Many of these things won't be safe. People have to think in the safety of theres and others. It is not a great idea If you let a car do everything for you because that could be dangerous. You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good.

Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars. We should stay with what we have until we are 100% sure about things. ",4
07e7133,"Dear Senator,

I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.

First off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don't spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winner-takes-all system as said by the Office of the Federal Regiser in ""What is the Electoral College?"". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state's population, but imagine this; California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this to-be-president and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn't get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren't for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ingnoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.

To continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we're voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who's gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you're really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.

Yours truly,

07f4106,"Facial Action Coding System allows computers around humans to read their emotion based by the look on their face. Dr. Huang tells that this device can tell your emotion because of the muscles in your face and how they are either tightened or relaxed. FACS should be used on students so teachers can help them talk it out, help them understand the material that is being teached and help them learn the emotion of people around them.

Using FACS on students should be allowed. If using FACS in a classroom full of teenagers, a teacher will just see a room filled with hormonal teens. They will just ignore it and think they are just moody. Or a teacher could see how upset a student is and ask if they are okay. This computer could become useful in helping students when they are upset or angry. If could allow the teacher to talk to them and check up on them every once in a while. FACS can detect the six basic emotions such as surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer will detect these emotions through the movement of the muscles.

Teachers can use FACS to help students understand the subject more clearly. Learning and understanding school is very important to young students, they need the knowledge to go and be successful in the future. Teachers want to know if a student is getting confused while listening to a lecture. It is important for teachers to know how to help their students. This computer will help out with the use of studying and scaning how their facial muscles are being moved or how their eyebrows are being lifted.

Knowing how someone around another could help out a lot. If this FACS could really detect human emotions just from the expression on the face and movement of the muscles then it could help a human understand how the person next to them is feeling. Zygomatic major are the muscles that begin in your cheek bones, they life the corners of your mouth. That muscle can determined if someone is giving a forced smile or genuine smile. This could help a person know when another is upset and needs space or if another is in need of comforting. It could also help to see if someone is angry and needs time to cool down.

FACS is able to help people talk out the emotion they are feeling, help them understand material that is being taught to them and help them learn the emotion of people around them. FACS will be able to conclude a feeling of a person and will possibly be able to help someone. Knowing how someone is feeling is very important because then people will know how to appoarch them and how to talk to them. FACS would be very successful in helping others out and it could be used to know a person feels. ",4
0811694,"Who doesn't like the idea of sitting back, sipping on your coffee while reading the paper as your car whisk you to your destination? Sadly, as wonderful as it may sound, that is not the case with ""Driverless Cars."" Driverless cars are not really a grand idea as they may seem because even though they say that they are driverless and are suppose to be safe, you must always be alert when driving them, there is a chance that the car maybe unsafe, and without a doubt, they are more than likely going to be expensive.

These suppose driveless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but it carries sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. And although the car is designed to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves, it is designed to notify the driver when it requires human skills on a road ahead. Which then require the driver of this ""driverless car"" to be alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. This makes the term driverless car pointless.

Having to always be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world and it isn't the only thing that people have to worry about. In many states they have banned the use of computer driven cars because they believe that humans are the only safe drivers. Although in many cases this may not be true, a human driver seems more truthworthy than a computer that may or may not short circut at any moment. Humans seem to be more reliable but if people ever see to change their minds and laws change, it will still come down to one question as stated in the text, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?

Other than these cars being unsafe, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably cost them an arm and a leg. Seeing as how these smarter cars are suppose to be smarter and more high tech. Which leads to the next question, what makes a ""smarter car"" smarter? Well according to the passage Google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear whieel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, an intertial motion sensor, and a dubbed LIDAR, not including the things inside the car. This all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash and as time progresses and technology improves, so will the sensors and as things get better, the preformence will go up but so will the value, making the car more expensive to make.

Ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, don't seem so smart or so driverless because they still require a driver to be alert, they don't seem so safe, and they will probably cost a ton of money. So they require a drivers assistance everytime it can't do anything on its own, making the name driverless car pointless. Another human being would seem more trutworthy behind the wheel than a computer. Then lastly they probbaly cost more than a colege students yearly tuition. Need there be more said about why driverless cars are just a bad idea? ",4
082e9df,"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking concepts to the suburbs. Residents of an upscale community in Germany have given up their cars, generating a revolutionary change.

Limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, a resident of Bogota, Columbia. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, but thanks to the partial driving ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. By reducing the amount of driving we do, we could decrease the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into our atmosphere, ultimately creating a greener, healthier enviornment for all of earths inhabitants.

An improvement in society is also being made due to the ambitious goals to decrase car usage. Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout cities; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The worlds love affair with vehicles seem to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly nine percent below the peak and equal to where the countr was in January of 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures, the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. If the pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.

""All of our development since World War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. By decreasing the amount of car usage, we could generate enough change to truly change the world.    ",4
0848273,"The ""face on Mars"" is not a face at all. The shadows cause this landformation to appear to have a mouth, nose, and eyes. In the 2001 photo it was summer, so there was no shadows to cast the facial features as in the 1976 photo. If Nasa really discovered life on Mars they would tell the public because it would be a huge discovery. These conspiracy theorists say aliens are so smart, well if they are so smart why haven't they contacted us.

Why would these oh so genious aliens waste time on making this face? I'll tell you why, because they dont exist it was just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The people of Nasa have done as much as they can with this natural landformation. They took another photo in 1998 after the first photo because they wanted to prove it wasn't aliens.

The photo in 2001 proved that it was not an alien creation. These theorists say all these things that make Nasa seem so protective and amke it seem like they hide information. If Nasa were hiding information why would they release the photo in the first place. If it were alien markings and they knew about it why take two more photos, to prove the theorists were wrong. One day they will land on Mars, and Nasa will prove to us that there are no ancient life forms there. When they land and prove us wrong the conspiracy theorists will stay say they are lying.

The theorists love to make people believe what they want because it's all about the best conspiracy. If one were to have the better conspiracy they would knock their compition out of the way. They make money on how many subscribers they get and the better the conspiracy, the more subscribers.

Some poeple will always doubt what Nasa really searches for. They don't understand that Nasa is not in it for personal gain. They are searching for answers for answers about our universe and if there was alien life forms Nasa would tell the people with so much joy and wonder. One day we will know the truth.",4
087c663,"Twenty-five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spotted a giant shadowy figure that looked like a head on Mars. Many people belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by unknown life forms, but this is clearly not the case. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is just a mesa that formed on the Red Planet. Mesas are very common around the American West, and it's no surprise that one could turn up on Mars. In paragraph 12, Jim Garvin states ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

If the Face on Mars was created by unknown life forms, NASA would have no reason to hide it. Many conspiracy theorists state that NASA is hiding the truth from us. They believe that the Face on Mars is key evidence for life on Mars, but if that was true NASA wouldn't hide it.

if they found life on Mars, NASA could get much more funding for their research. They would make millions of dollars out of it. If they had found spmething that intriguing, they wouldn't even think of keeping it a secret.

Many believe that maybe it was just a bad picture and thatthere could be hidden alien markings, but there were many diferent pictures taken. NASA was able to take several photos at many different times, so there would be no way that they missed something. NASA has new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry that shows that the Face on Mars is just a simple mesa.

088fd5c,"When you turn sixteen, you're filled with anticipation and anxst of getting your liscence, and furthermore a car! I know, I have certaintly been there. But, what's so good about getting a car? Well, other than the new found sense of freedom. Not much. Car usage has accelerated since the 1900's and is starting to gradually decline. Why? Less stress, less pollution, and more excerise. These things alone may not be enough to convince you, so let's jump into the facts.

First off, getting rid of that car in your driveway will greatly lower your stress. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"""". When you think about it, it truly makes sense. When you have a car you have to worry about gas prices, payments, and fixes. But, when you live a car free life none of that is of your concern. So, therefore your stress decreases and your happiness can go up to an all time high. When you have one less bill each month it truly does leave an impact.

Secondly, we have a big issue that is in our hands... Pollution and smog. Who's fault is it? Ours. Fumes and smoke crowding into our atmosphere with no where else to go. Our cars are a huge part of it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed"" in France for their smog layers. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" We need to put a stop to this. It is destroying our planet. It will continue to destroy it until we make a change and do something to make this stop. It's in our hands and we can't just let it go. The problem will not just go away. It will not just fix itself.

When you are living in this day in age many people have cars, so they have no need to go out and walk, or skate, or bike anywhere because they have a more ""efficiant"" way of transportation. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,"" This means that people would be getting up and active to get to work and other places that they may need to be. Helping our environment and themselves.

Furthermore, cars are slowly but surely being forgotten, people are stopping their use of cars and taking alternative transportation. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling."" So, it's not as big of a deal as it used to be. Not everyone needs or wants to have a car anymore. ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for the carbon emmissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" When you decide that you don't want a car, you're benefiting from it and the future is benefiting from it. Taking the next step seems a bit out of reach but we can make it.

In conclusion, people see cars as something that is a must have. Or, a next step in their freedom. But, we can change that. Show the world that it is more harmful than helpful. ""One small step for man, a leap for mankind."" We can get there, but it takes more than one person to set down the keys. Reduce your stress, reduce the pollution, and increase your happiness. All it takes is one person to start a movement.    ",4
0890d0b,"The the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" display both positive and negative aspects about driverless cars. Everyone looks foward to the feature because of new technology that could make life easier but we really dont think about the bad that can come from these new divices. In my personal opinion I think that the negative aspects outweigh the positive aspects when it comes to driverless cars.

Even though driverless cars can possibaly be good for the economy because they use half the fuel of today's taxis they also have a large amount of cons that many people don't ever think about because they are blinded by the fact that these cars can basically get you where you need to go with little to no assistance from you, the manually driver. Even though driverless cars can get you where you need to go with hardly no assistance from you there will also be times when they do need your assistance, like if there is a accident or when there are road closes ahead. Although the car can alert you will you be to destracted by other things, such as cell phones, to pay attention to the signals that the car is giving you? Many drivers are probably more likley to to get bored while they are waiting for their turn to drive and this can result in accedents or something of that nature becaue you, the destracted driver, has missed the warning signales that the car is giving off to you.

Also people look at the aspect that just because they might be saving money by getting these cars because they will save money on gas and think that they are getting a better deal. But however, these cars are basically computer cars and if there is a problem with electrical pieces in the car it could be very pricey. Also since these cars are besically ran off of these computers that means of a part if messed up th car will not function properly.

Even though these cars can possabily be safer for the public when it comes to drunk drivers, what if these cars have a malfunction or technical diffuclitys? That could also be very harming to the public and you. If these driverless cars has a malfunction it could also put your life in danger along with the other people around you.

In conclusion, driverless cars has its pros and cons but when you actually think about it, the cons outweigh the pros. Just because you have this driverless car does not make you anymore safer than a person with a non driverless car. Just like regular cars, driverless cars has cons to it as well. Driverless carscan have expensive repairs and malfunctions just like regular cars can have. In my opnion driverless cars can have just as big of a risk as regular cars do. ",4
089e8f5,"All I am imagining is a lot of arguements and court cases on drivers getting angry with manufactures, and manufactures getting fighting back, claiming it is not their fault. If driverless cars are introduced to the rest of the world, there will me so many accidents and court cases that will be very tricky, because no one knows who is at fault. I believe that driverless cars are not reliable, at least not yet, and I know that I would not use a driverless car unless there are a lot of improvements made.

Sometimes machines just shut down and stop working for no apparent reason. Sometimes there are problems with robotic things that no one knows why the problem is occuring. In paragraph 2 it explains that, ""they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This shows that the cars, at least not yet can work all on there own. The driver still has to be alert and watching the road at all times, because at anytime the car could see something that it does not think it could handle, so the driver has to be ready at any time to step in and be ready to take over. Then again, machines sometimes have problems that just occur for no apparent reason, so maybe the car could just shut down and might not alert the driver so then right away there is a risk of a crash. Who then is at fault. In paragraph 9, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?the driver or the manufacturer?"" If this happens who is to blame? The driver was told that they would be alterted when something the car couldn't handle occurs, but if the driver isn't alerted, then it must be the manufactures fault. But wait, the manufacurers made it clear thar the driver still has to be watching, and if they were not, then again, who is to blame? There are so many questions that either can't be answered, or take a lot of time to figure the answer out.

I personaly would not even think about using a driverless car until the manufactures figure out all the problems with the safty issues. It is not just the car itself that there needs to be work done on, according to paragraph 9, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" There are so many laws that would have to change and be made. So even if there are improvement on the car itself there are still also so many other things that you have to consider when thinking of using a driverless car.

I don't know after reading this passage, if I would ever really feel safe trusting a machine with my life and even of those around me. There are so many issues still that need to be fixed before I would consider testing one out. I need to make sure that myself and those around me would be safe if something were to go wrong with the car. Driverless cars are a new and interesting idea, but they need a lot of work to be done on them before they would be safe enough to be introduced to the rest of the world.",4
08a4c92,"What if there was a program that helped countries around the world? There is and it's called the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is amazing and I know because I was in it. By the time I was 18, I made nine trips with the Seagoing Cowboys program. I'm Luke Bomberger and here are reasons why you should join this program.

The first reason why you should join this program is you can see lots of amazing sites. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece, which I thought was special. In Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, I got to take a gondola ride. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Also, you should join because you get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. That's how they started the Seagoing Cowboys so that they could take care of animals. When I went the first time, there was a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. If you like animals, there's one more reason to join.

Another reason you should join is because of what happened during World War 2. What happened during that war was that countries were left in ruins. I went and trust me, this really changes the way you think about other countries and the world.

This is my favorite reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys, the fun games during the trip. We used to always play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would also have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. I have to say that they were awesome and helped time pass by.

The final reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it can open up your world like it did to me. I used to work at a bank and a grocery store and I never expeced this to happen to me. I'm grateful for the opportunity because it made me more aware of other peoples lives and what they and their country need to continue thier lives. Now, that awareness is still with me and I lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Take it from me, being a Seagoing Cowboy is awesome and helps you learn about the countries around the world. You can see and do cool things and make a difference in a persons life and a countries life. You should agree with the reasons why I said to join the Seagoing Cowboys because I went and joined and it changed my life. That's why you need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.",4
08a5c68,"Cars have helped people over the years, but has it helped the enviorment or your heath. When driving a car, the car releases gases that can effect the air around us. There are advantages of limiting the use of cars, like a heathier enviroment and a heathier body.

One advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier enviroment. When you are driving a car the gas in the car, is let out into the air. The gas that gose in the air can effect the air and plants around us, as it can turn to toxic. As the source Elisabeth Rosenthal explains, 50 percent of the greenhouse gases are caused by car-intensive areas in the United States. The gas from are cars are not just effecting are air, there effecting are greenhouse to. The source Robert Duffer tells us, how paris banded using cars after days of near-record pollution to clear the air. After days of no cars the air was clear again. As you can tell, limmiting car uses will help the enviroment alot.

Forthermore, Another advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier body. Instead of just siting in a car you can ride a bike,walk or roller skate. Also all those gases from the car wont be going in your body, effecting your insides. As the source Andrew Selsky explains, in Colombia on free car day the people hicked,skated and bicked to get where they need to go, instead of using a car. Without a car to take you places you will get exercie, which will give you power and engery for your body. A normal person should also exercise for 30 mintes a day. Also as Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us without a car you have less stress and are able to relax more. Cars can cause people alot of stress, and a alot of stress is not good for your body. Limiting the use of cars has a great effect on your heath.

Conslusion, Limiting the use of cars will have the advantages of a heathier enviroment and a heathier body. The enviroment and your body is a big thing in your life, so you would want to do whatever possible to keep it heathy. So instead of talking the car try to walk or ride a bike next time.    ",4
08c3b51,"The author has great passion for this topic but has not accomplished on supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danges. The author has many points on how others are trying to solve the problems on how to explore Venus but does not explain why the risk is worthy of exicuting. ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk."" This quote states that scientist need to take a risk but does not give a reason why the risk is neccesary. This is not the only way the author did not accomplish on supporting the idea.

The author explains the history of Venus and its properties but that does not help support the idea. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This quote explains how the risk of exploring and studying Venus was lower ""long ago"" but does not explain or supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. This is not the only way the author does not support the idea successfully.

As a question can be the upbringing or curosity and reasoning, the author seems to not give a response to the question on supporting the idea. ""The value of returning to Venuse seems indisputable, but what are the options of making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" The athour questions possible options on how to get both saftey and productivity, but does not question the risks and possible dangers of exploring Venus. As the passage continues the author only explains the options and possible ways on exicuting the idea but does not include the risks that the options hold.

As the passage is very informative and holds great information, the author supports very poorly the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author explains solutions that are a possobility but does not include the risks of the idea. The author also informs the audience about the history of Venus but boes not help on supporting the idea of studying Venus. The author unfortuntly, poorly supported the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",4
08c6a31,"Using the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classroom. Many students often get bored, distracted, or just lose focus when being taught a lesson that doesn't interest them. Of course you can't just not learn the lesson, since you are learning because it will come to use later on. Therefore, I believe that with help from your computer screen, you could stay on track with your work.

Often times, teachers use different teaching styles based on what allows their students to learn most effectively. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers could do so, too. For example, say you're reading an excerpt on the computer and it's not really on a topic that interests you, most students would immediately lose attentiveness to the reading. This is not a good thing, especially if the information was important, useful, or for a grade. But, with the Facial Action Coding System, this problem could be solved. The system could be used to spice up the learning, or keep the teaching style stays the same way if the student is staying attentive.

Many people learn in a different way. Some students are more effectively taught by learning visually, others hands-on, and some verbally. The Facial Action Coding system could recognize these based on students facial expressions. If the student is looking focused while seeing a diagram, the system could see they're a visual learner, and keep teaching the topic in that way. Otherwise if that doesn't work, the system could see if the student's emotions would change based on if they could listen to the information instead of reading.

Based on the positive characteristics of the Facial Action Coding System, I believe we should have the technology at school. The system could really be put to use, especially if it could help students learn and understand topics in an easier way. The emotion reading technology would be extremely valuable to have in a classroom.   ",4
08cec1d,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states very clearly how beneficial studying Venus would be, despite all the dangers. Even after learning how harsh the conditions are on ground level, for some reason, the author still believes the danger would be worth it. Though my own opinion may vary from the author's, they still give very convincing reasons for their point of view. According to the article, the main two reasons Venus would be beneficial for humans to study would be the amount of information that could be learned about the landscape of Venus millions of years ago, and to satisfy human curiosity while having the satisfaction completing a challenge we have been faced with for centuries.

Though the author gives several convinving reasons for studying Venus, perhaps the most influential would be the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus. In paragraph four, the author discusses that Venus displays several features similar to Earth, meaning it is possible Venus used be a whole lot like Earth. As stated directly in paragraph four, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" Solely based off the information provided in this quote, the author has already begun to convince me learning more about Venus might actually lead to some pretty extraordinary discoveries. What this quote is saying is millions of years ago Venus may have been the planet with the most liveable conditions...instead of Earth. If scientists were able to discover this much, just imagine all the other life forms and food webs that could be uncovered. To reinforce their opinion on Venus potentislly being liveable in the past, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can cometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" at the end of paragraph four. What the author is saying in this quote is at this point, all we have to do is find out how to brave the conditions of Venus. As for travel time, Venus is practically our neighbor, so no worries there.

A secondary reason the author provides as to why humans should study Venus is to satisfy human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task that has troubled humans for centuries. The author states this idea in paragraph eight when saying, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" In this quote, the author is saying due to the fact that humans are extremely curious, we will likely find ourselves in a predicament with similar tough challenges in the future, so we may as well begin working through some of them now. When one sets out to complete a task, they should not stop halfway, but follow through until the problem is solved. They also should not quit because they believe the challenge is too hard. If one is able to stick with their guts and do what needs to be done, they will reap the benefits. Whether those benefits be winning a tough volleyball match or finally sending a human to Venus, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that we do not stop believing in ourselves and our ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible.

In conclusion, the author has given many, specifically two, very convincing reasons as to why we should continue to study Venus. The main two reasons are the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus, and satisfying human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task which has troubled humans for centuries. Based on the authors suggestions on why humans should continue to study Venus, I have considered changing my mind and agreeing that the dangers would be worth it. It is important to have knowledge about the past of our solar system, and it would be very interesting to know if Venus was once able to support various forms of life. I also feel that the author made a good point in stating that we are already this far into studies, so we should not give up now. Humans are always going to be insatiably curious, so by not finding a solution to this problem now, we are just placing this challege upon the generation following us. After all, curiosity technically never killed the cat. ",4
08d4d59,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tells the reader about the challenges that there are for exploring Venus. It also talks about reasons why reseachers and scientist should not give up on the exploration of Venus. In the passage, the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how the trip could be made safer, the technology that can be used, and the value of exploring the planet.

The author supports the idea that Venus is worth exploring by explaining and giving examples on how travelling to Venus could be made safer. In the article, it says ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" In other words, this proves how the trip to explore Venus can be made more safer. Furthermore, the author supports his idea by giving examples and explaining how the exploration of Venus can be safe.

Another way the author supports his idea is by explaining the techonlogy that can be used to explore Venus. In paragraph 7 of the article, it states ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This shows how this type of technology can be used for the further exploration of Venus.

Lastly, another way that the author supports his idea is by explaining what the value would be if humans explore Venus. In the last paragraph of the article, it says ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" It also states ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This proves what the value of exploring Venus would be for humans. In other words, the author supports his idea by explaining the opportunities and values of exploring Venus.

Furthermore, the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the travel safety, the technology that can be used, and the value of exploring Venus. The technology that humans have right now can bring so many opportunities, such as exploring new planets. These opportunities should be used now and not be on hold. ",4

Driving makes a hug impact in the human life. Ever since the first car was invented, humans have had to travel in a shorter way. The transportation way is heading a new direction since techology is improving we can see the difference bewteen the first car to a car that could be able to drive by itself.

Having a future where no body has to drive a car by themselves sounds pretty impresive. But you also have to think about what could those types of cars can give us and make our lifes better. These new inventions have not all been successful, but the companies making them are making progress by finding new ways to make these types of cars go more then just a small traveling distance and then stop. In my point of view these cars could actually give us the chance of not having to stop for a rest when you're tired, watch movies or televison shows while your car is still running. They could save us from spending so much money on gas and some could be safe for the enviroment.

Companies such as Google, have had cars that could be drive independently under specific conditons since 2009. There have been cars that have drove more then just a few miles with out even causing an accident. Cars that are truly driverless may help dealing with complicated traffic issues.Not only are they working on Smart cars but also smart roads.In order for the car to travel where you would like to go, they might develop a system where the road could have a binary code in order for the car to remember the places you travle to.

The car would really have to be smarter for those types of ideas, they have worked with a lot of people to have a clear view of what the car could look and drive like. Every car needs ways to protect the passengers. And so automakers find new ways to prevent accidents incase they every happen with these types of cars. Automakers are continuing their work on the ways there could be a car that has all the abilities of having good safety measures and having the ability to drive on there own.",4

The Vauban's started? getting involved and getting informed on not using a car. Soon 70 percent of Vauban's familiy does not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move to Germany. Some even liked the idea of not using a car ""When I had a care I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. She nows walks verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. in 2006 Vauban completed, this is an example of growign trend in Europe, the united States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, this is a movement of ""smart planning."" The advantage is you will have more access to public transportation, a disadvantage is if you live far from public places then you might have to walk or take a bus.

In Paris they have enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). Nearly 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesels engines int he rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. The advantage of not having a car is that you wouldn't be spending money on gas, the disadvanteage is that you will be fined. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made fro plug-in cars, hybirds, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. After the smog ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. There is alot of disadvantages because would you have a work day on Tuesday and you have an odd numbered plate. Also soem people are not familar with the public transportation and some people may not think it's the best way to get around in town. You also have to get up eary to catch the bus, train, etc.

The goal was to promote alternative? transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. In Bogota there were occasional rain showers . Some thought it was a good idea some not so much. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress in lower air pollution,"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

So driving with a car or not it either good or bad because not driving could give you the excerise and driving just means you like your personal things. I think that when? the government says it's a fine then follow the rules. Either way not having a car does has it advantages every country should have a car-free day.       ?       ?       ???       ?????       ?    ",4

NASA is working on different projects to study venus. He also states that challenging to meet venus has a value to it. But visiting venus can be dangerous too.

In the article "" the challange of exploring venus"" The author describes

the planet venus as a ""evening star"" because it brights up since venus is close to the sun. Astronomers are integuiered by venus because it's not only close to the earth and sun, venus can be a earth lookalike because of it's features.In the article it states this "" the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains,and carters."" The author describes that venus can be like earth becuase of how both plantes have moutains and valleys. Another quote from paragraph 4 states that ' venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.. even though there could be a long time frame of space travel.""

Even though being able to visit venus is intresting

the plan on getting over there can take up days or even weeks.

NASA has found ways to study the planet venus. For example using technology to study it. In paragraph 7 it says "" electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber of venus""s surface and it lasted 3 weeks."" This sentence states

that the group working on this project succeded into making a technology that lasts a long time to prove that it works. Another tech they could use is an old one that contributed in World War 2. That computer is powerful and flexible to manage instead of using wired up compueters."" sysytems that use mechanical parts can be made more resisting to heat."" Meaniing that this technology resists heat and scientist or Astronomers can study peacefully in a safe way therefore no one is in risks.

In advance to the challenges the author thinks that visiting venus is in great value. Why?because since venus has been more earth alike and NASA has been investigating new ideas to study the planet it brings it to be an interesting journey to take. In paragraph 8 it reads that "" huamn curiousity will likeky lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" The author is saying that the eager of the people to know about venus can raise to popularity. Author also says "" traveles should'nt let the doubts and danger expand to meet imagination and innovation."" The author doesn't want people to let the rumors or the challenges of doing something to stop them from adventuring.

Even though Studing venus or going up to space to visit venus is adenturing, Venus can also be dangerous for humans. In paragraph 3 it says "" Venus

has the hottest temperature that can cause earthquakes, erupting volanoes, and bad weather."" This could cause a huaman death because your headed to an envirement that has

high temperature and lightning strikes. also "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything huamns encounter of earth."" What this sentence is refferng to is that since we are not used to extreme heat, our bodies wouldn't be able to hamdle the heat.

Despite the danger that venus can be There is still ways to being able to study the planet Venus. As the author states that Atromomers are intrguied by it and NASA has safe ways of studying venus.Plus even the challenges of venus brings a good value.",4
0916f2c,"The Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to everyday school life. This computer system can help with several things from elementary school to college. This could also change the way the world works forever. The FACS can easily be an important part of our education society.

The first and most effective thing FACS would impact is student's attitudes in the classroom. If FACS was active on all of the students computers, it could detect their emotions to influence them to get back on track and focus. It could also simply just keep the concentration going about the lesson being instructed. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6) . This can improve the interaction in class and can also improve many students grades.

If FACS was implemented into schools, students would feel more involved in the lecture, and pay attention more while being extra alert. Students will also be more knowledegable due to the fact that they are taking in information and really getting to learn about it, instead of just trying to find the answers that will satisfy on a worksheet or test. While feeling more involved, alert, and learning a lesson with full attention, this will impact grades greatly. This will help even more students proceed on into the next step of education, which is college.

FACS would benefit in grade school and would most definitely continue to help students in college. College can get difficult, but FACS could influence to keep students focused when they seem to become overwhelmed by their expressions. If students are impacted by FACS when they are younger and proceed on to college while continuing their education, there then comes a career. FACS will help in high school to get you to a college of your dreams, also best fit for your major. Then in college, it will help you focus and be actively listening and learning about your major to help you find a career that best fits you and your abilities. If everyone could have the opportunity to have the career as what best suits them, they will have an easier life and being more helpful to the people around them.

If FACS started being used in elementary school, proceeded to middle school, and so on in high school; it will teach students the habit of fully paying attention in class and being active. It will improve grades greatly. It will also help college students stay focused, even when times seem to become difficult. They will also already be influenced to stay active and fully aware of the lesson in class. If a student has well listening skills and is knowledgeable of their major, they will find the best job for theirself. If more people began to find jobs that benefitted them, and they were happy doing it, it would impact more than just students, it would impact the whole world.             ",4

You would travel on a ship with animals and other cowboys to help people who's life seems to be in ruins.

It might just change your life, like it changed mine.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you won't regret it. It was a whole lot of fun. I got to meet other cowboys and you never get bored. When I was on board ships, especially on the way back, we played games and had some pretty fun competitions. We used to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty space that used to house animals. We fenced, boxed, and held table-tennis tournaments. It was a lot of fun!

You get to help people; this is a big reason to join. You get to become part of an organization that helps people who need it, desperately. You could become their hero. Becoming part of something like this changes your whole life. It made me selfless and aware of the world around me. That awareness has been with me through my whole life. Although I'm no longer a Seagoing Cowboy, I'm still aware of what's happening to people around the world and how lucky I am. I let international students and exchange visitors into my house as an effort to help.

Creating driverless cars in the world seems like a big deal today. In all reality, having driverless cars around the world can be an accident just waiting to happen. If you really think about it, teenagers would most likely be the main ones buying driverless cars. Drinking while driving, texting, and falling asleep may accur when entering a driverless car. Is creating a car that drives on it's own really worth costing a life?

Drinking when driving is a huge mistake people tend to make. Giving them a car that works on its own, and allows you to sit there and get more drunk is not a very bright idea. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If you are drunk and the car alerts you to take control you may not even respond.

Texting and driving happens with anyone and everyone. People are way too focused on seeing what their friend sent them instead of paying attetion to the road. Alot of collisions have happend because of one driver texting and driving. "" Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters they need a whole lot of sensors."" Say those sensors just happend to suddenly cut off and not give any warning. How will a person know when to look up from their addictive phone?

Working hard days 24/7 can make a person extreamly sleepy. Say you get off of work and your exhausted, and a peaceful song comes on the radio. While listening to that song you fall into a deep sleep while your car takes you back to your house. ""Their cars have driven more than half a mile without a crash."" Maybe the test cars didn't have a problem with the driverless cars but what if somthing breaks in your car and it loses control? The sleepy driver is in deep sleep and could die from the driverless car manufacturing.

In conclusion, having a driverless car does not make the world any safer nor better. It gives people a better chance to drink and drive, text and drive, even sleep and drive. How is making driverless cars anysafer yet better to the world?

In all reality, it makes it more dangerous. ",4
0947cdc,"There are several advantages when you limit car usage. One, you will reduce greenhouse gases. Two, you will lower the stress level of people when they thinking about driving. Three, young people will decrease their amount of driving. Overall, limiting car usage can help fellow citizens.

Limiting car usage wil reduce greenhouse gases. In Source 1 the passage states that passaenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. While we limit car usage you will not only help reduce greenhouse gases,but you will help reduce air pollution. When theres no air pollution there will be a clean atmosphere. Furthermore, limiting car usage can benefit the enviorment.

Limiting car usage will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Everyday people have to plan before they drive. Sometimes when people plan for driving they get stressed thinking about if theirs traffic or what if the road is closed. In Source 3 the passage states that rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Furthermore, limiting car usage will limit the stress level of people thinking about driving.

Limiting car usage will decrease young people's amount of driving. In Source 4 the passage states that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license. Another study in Source 4 was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If their's less young people driving then there will be less accidents occuring. Overall, limiting car usage will keep young drivers from injurying themselves.

Either way limiting car usage will help our fellow citizens in general. This will reduce greenhouse gases. This will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Also, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of young people driving. Futhermore limiting car usage will help us citizens.    ",4
0952aee,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process but is time we move on from it. Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes. ""It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"" (source 3) This may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college.

This process is also unfair to voters because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (source 2).

There has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes including ..."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO"" (Source 2). These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past.

Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes. In my eyes it appears the electoral college has slightly to much impact on the outcome of the election. Imagine running for president and you when the hearts of the voters with popular votes but happen to lost the election because you didn't have enough electoral votes. How would you feel about the electoral college after that experience? This is why there is a need for change in the electoral college. Save candidates from losing an election that they should have one but didn't becuase they didn't have enough electoral votes.       ?       ??????       ?       ?     ",4
095d62a,"Technology is becoming a bigger part of our lives. As time goes on, we develop new technology for different purposes. One such purpose is to read emotions. This technology will benefit our society in different ways, like in education. The technology to read students emotions is valuable to our schools.

The first way in which this technology is vaulable to schools is by improving lessons. Often times, many students of different calibers are thrust into the same classroom. While some grow bored others become confused by the content of the lesson. In the article, Dr. Huang is quoted saying, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.? If we implemented this emotion recognition technology, we could help students of all levels grow and reach their potential.

Another reason why technology that can recognize emotions is vaulable in schools is because of fighting and bullying. In paragraphs three and four of the article, it discusses how the technology works and what it can do. It claims that it can dectect mixed emotions and even, in paragraph 8, detect fake smiling. This technology could be used to detect when students are angry and wanting to fight or even sad from being bullied. Teachers cannot always detect these things from students, especially if they are trying to hide them.

In addition to stopping fights and helping bullied students, this emotion recognition technology could assist in identifying students who have problematic home lives and need help. Although this would not always be 100% accurate, it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. This would aid in making schools a happier place. It could also negate problems that they could have later in life. Installing this technology in our schools would be highly beneficial.

Schools need the technology to read students emotions. It would fit in with other technological advancements that have improved our education system. Advances in technology helped to improve not just our education, but our overall lives. Numerous people in our world cannot live without technology. Technology is important to our society.

096b178,"Cars are used used in everyday life but they may be used too much because of all the?damage they do to the environment and the citizens must be informed on it. Cars are used to help get around easier unless if towns are developed so that people can walk or ride a bike everywhere. Cars cause pollution which causes smog and it can really hurt peoples health and the environment. A life without cars can make plenty of people happy due to the fact that people get injured or die in cars every day.

To start off most towns do not build buildings close together because people have cars which takes up more time to get there and money for gas. If buildings were made closer together everyone could get to the stores quickly and back home in time for special events. If buildings were made closer gasoline would be less of a problem due to the prices being high. In a town called Vauban in Germany seventy percent of all families do not own an automobile.""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car,and that will have to change"" said David Goldberg.

Cars are known to cause pollution and some places have a partial ban on cars. Paris is well known for the Eiffel Tower and also its pollution problem so Paris allowed people with even and odd number license plates to only drive on certain days or else they will be fined. When cars cause pollution it makes smog and smog can kill crops and animals if it gets out of control. Currently heavily populated areas such as Newyork has a big pollution problem causing grey skies.

A life without cars is a happy one according to some people. A place in Colombia calles Bogota made an event called ""Car-free day"" which is a day where everyone goes the entire day without driving ""It's a good opportunity to take away streaa abd lower air pollution"".""These people are generating a revolutionary change and it is crossing boarders"".""The rain hasn't stopped anyone from participating"".

The reasons people should cut down on car usage is to lower pollution in the air. It just makes people happier without vehicles. Towns could be made with closer buildings to prevent using too much gas. Smog can really make an environment unhealthy by killing some of the plants that are there.    ",4
0975e3f,"Driverless cars might not be just a myth or a fantasy anymore. Google has had cars that can drive independantly since 2009. Though they have gone more than half a million miles without a crash, there are cons to these typs of cars. They arn't entirely driverless yet. These cars still need help getting through places like work zones and accidents. These cars are expensive and still need human help, but they do come with a special safety feature that normal cars don't have.

Driverless cars can be helpful, but they are still expensive. The roads would more than likely have to be updated. General Motors and engineers from Berkeley have both tried different ways to improve the roads. This included roads embedded with electrical cables or magnets, sending signals to the car. These methods proved to be unreasonably expensive. Engineers then looked at making smarter cars. To make them smart enough to drive safely without the help of people and smart roads they would need many sensors. They would need at least nine different sensors. Putting that many sensors on enough cars for everyone to drive would be very costly.

People could also benefit from these cars if they truly were driverless. These so called ""driverless"" cars can't do many things a person can do while driving. For instance, these cars can't pull in or out of driveways. They also can't make it through roadwork or accidents. Currently, the fastest that driverless cars can handle is 25 miles per hour. This would definitly not be safe on a highway or interstate. These cars are ment to take people where they need to go, but the driver must remain focus if they need to take the wheel.

There are pros to cars like these though. There has to be something to keep the ""driver"" interested while waiting for their turn to drive, so some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. If there is something that keeps the driver entertained, there has to be something to get them alert again. These entertainment features can be turned off when needed, pulling the drivers attention back to the road. These safety percautions arn't currently in cars for texting and driving.

Though these cars do come with a safety feature, they are still expensive and can't fully drive alone. I do believe the world can benefit from these cars, but i see to many red flags for them to be reasonable at this time. ",4
0999761,"Driverless cars are about to be the future. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, has a dreams of a future with public transportation system where driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. In my opinion, driverless cars are going to be brilliant. I believe just like Sergey that driverless cars can change the world. And google is making sure it is all safe.

The cars that Sergey imagines would use half the fuel of today's taxis. That is absolutly great way to save money on gas. The driverless cars would offer way more flexibility than any bus.

Google has already had cars that could drive independently since 2009. Those cars have passed many tests for saftey. The cars have also driven more than half a million miles without crashing. Google's cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in or out of a driveway, and dealing with complicated traffic. For example passing an accident or going through roadwork.

To improve these smart cars they needed a whole lot of senors. The car google modified was a Toyota Prius. Google put postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The most important piece google put on the car was the spinning sensor on the roof. The spinning sensor on the roof uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surrondings. All these senors google is using is necessary for the driverless car to mimic a human and the wheel.

Sensors were invented in the 1980's. Sensors have improved so much they can detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. Sensors can get information too cause the car to apply braked on individual wheels. Sensors can also reduce the power from the engine, which is far more that was a human can do from the wheel. Even with all the things sensors can do they still will keep improving.

In 2013, BMW developed the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car will be able to handle speeds up tp 25 mile per hour, but the senors from ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" will make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. The car can steer, brake, and accelerate themselves. But are designed to notify the drive when the road ahead requires human skills. For example going through a work zone or arounf accidents. The human must stay alert and be ready to take over when needed. GM has also developed the driver seat to viberate when they are in danger. Other options they have is flashing lights on the windsheild. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch the drivers remaining focused on the road.

Google is making sure all the driverless cars will be on the safe side. I believe driverless cars will change the world. In my opinion driverless cars need to be created for the future. If all the tests goes right there should be no problem. Sergey Brin has a dream for public transportation to be better. Driverless cars are about to be the future. ",4
09a04e4,"We are very close to Venus and Mars, and at some points we are closer to Venus than Mars and vise versa. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea that they want to send humans to Venus to study this planet, but there is a lot of dangers involved if they do that. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving all the reason why humans should go, bad things that could happen if humans landed on Venus, and things they can do to make this idea work.

NASA already beleives that there could be life on Mars and that people could be living on Mars in a couple decades or even less, so why wouldn't they want to find that out about another planet. It has already been suggested that there once was life on Venus. In paragrpah 4 it states ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"". NASA thinks that being on the land we would be able to study it better because they don't think peering at Venus from a ship orbiting is doing enough. It is also giving them challenges that they can work on the equipment to make it last longer.

In article ""the Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it does state the bad outcomes if we landed on Venus and what could go wrong. In paragraph 3 it talks about the conditions on Venus for example, ""On the planet's surface, temperaturess average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". It also states that the condition on Venus are more extreme than anything humans have encountered on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in or solar system. These things are very dangerous, but despite the dangers this article is still able to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit.

In paragraph 5 they focus on things they would have to do to avoid the dangerous conditions, for example one thing is allowing scientist to float above the fray. Floating over the fray of Venus would be just like our jet airplanes. The conditions in Venus are not easy, but they would be survivable for humas. The only way to study Venus well is by being on the planet because looking at venus far away can only provide limited insight on ground conditions. Scientist want to be able to take samples from the ground and from the rocks on Venus.

The dangers of going to Venus should not stop us. It is worth it to face some of the dangers to make history and discover new things especially on another planet. The dangers of Venus will only push scientist harder to find a way to make it to venus. It will also push them to design new technology that could stand being in Venus's conditions. There is many evidence to prove that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",4
09a62eb,"Driverless cars are an advance in technology, even though they are not fully self automatic yet .Driverless cars may not be fully driverless yet but in the future it is possible. Even if people dont like the idea of it its still going to happen. Driverless cars are not going to be any good for our generation.

Driving is something that you will need your full attention for even if the car is self driven it can still screw up. I don't personally see the point of somthing that is not going to help anyone. Chances are that there will be more accidents and more people will be injured or even die because all technology malfunctions at one point or another and there is no stopping that. Technology is a good thing when it is helping people. Times are changing and no one can stop it. In paragraph 9 it says who will be responsible if the car happens to mess up the manufacturer or the driver.

Think to yourself who would you hold responsible. Knowing that all technology malfunctions,not to mention the car would be overly priced just for it to be able to drive without a driver and sense things. Most people like being aware if their surroungings. What if the car stoped and the driverless addition stoped working .You would already be used to not driving and over all forget how to do it. You wouldn't be aware of where you are because you were to busy doing other things then to know your surroundings.

Knowing how to drive makes things easier on you. Technology is not always a good thing. Technology doesn't always work out the way you want it too its easy to look something up and the internet not give you what you want or what's true would you trust your care taking you to where ever? It's easy saying something is better because it has technology incorperated but is that really true.

Some things are better left with out all the added gadgets and I belive a car is one of those things. A car is more reliable when you personaly are controling it. You know where you are going and I think if they want to make additions to are car make tires that don't go flat or make the car fix its self. Knowing how to get places yourself will make things so much easier on you. If your tire goes flat your car can not take you to the nearest area to call someone or get help.

My opinon over all driverless cars help no one. They make nothing easier and will not be affordale for the average person. They will malfunction more then a regular car and make accidents more common.",4
09b7afb,"Thier are a bunch of reasons for not using a car I can name you 10 off the top of my head. It limits pollution saves money great excerise thier multiple reasons not to drive a car everday.

For example if you limit your car use to 3 times a week you would save a ton of money. Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article ""Pairs bans driving due to smog"" that congestion was down 60 percent in the captial of france after 5 day of intensifiying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car acciedent.

In the passage ""car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" that they for one whole day dont use cars. They instead ride bikes every where because they want to reduce smog as Pairs wants to. In the passage it says that since its such a big hit that two more colombian cites, Cail and Valledupar joined the event. They have built over 118 miles of bike paths, the most of any latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. It also says that ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Also that day lets people probaly enjoy life way more because all you can do is ride bike and walk so they probaly go on adventures.

The final reason why you limit car use is thier would be less of a chance for you to get hurt or even worse. Thier are many acciedent evey year because of drunk and reckless drivers many have lost thier lives to idiots on the road. Thier was a story on the news that three teenage kids died in a car acciedent because they where under the influnce of drugs. They could have hurt other people the reporter said they crashed into a store and the store owner almost got hurt. Those kids almost took someone else life which is scary but if you limit your car use thier wont be that many acciedents.

All in all if you just limit your use of the car you can be helping out a bunch. The pollution can be reduced not as many car acciedents you can save your self some money. Also you can get more excersie in if you dont use your car that often.       ????       ?    ",4
09bd6f6,"Driverless cars are not a good idea for the future. They will create safety problems, cause more people to become obese, and cause more problems between the manufactuer and the customer.

Driverless cars will create a lot of safety problems. Drivers will think it is okay to sit back and relax on a road trip. If they were to fall asleep and there were to be a bad accident, the driver could have a possibility of sooner death. The driver would be more alert without a special car to drive for him. In the article it said that some manufactuers of the driverless car wanted to put entertainment in the cars. The driver will be too distracted. Putting entertainment in front of the driver is basically the same thing as putting a phone in front of them, which is illegal, and killed many people in car accidents. Needless to say, there can be many safety problems.

Driverless cars will cause many to become obese. Some people are already too lazy to walk a block down the street so they choose to drive. If driverless cars were to start selling, can you imagine how much more lazy people would get? They wouldn't have to do such a simple task such as turnihng the wheel, or turning there turning signals on. People will start bringing more and more food in the car if there happens to be entertainment. People need to excercise even if it is just a walk down the block. Obesity is not what people want.

Imagine getting in an accident in a driverless car. Many people will not take the blame because in all honesty, it wasn't their fault. They weren't the ones driving the car, so how it could it have been their fault? Customers will want their money back from buying the ""amazing"" driverless car they bought. Manufactuers will only be making more trouble for themselves. This will only result in more conflict. This will create worldwide problems.

As a result these futuristic cars are just not a good idea. It will only end in conflict. I think that people should stick to the regular cars they have. There is nothing wrong with cars we have in todays society.    ",4
09cc092,"Dear Florida state senator,

The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is non-democratic way in most people's eyes.

Although, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.

I said it was a non-democratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of Independance was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.

Speaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outragously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and Claifornia has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.

In the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a non-democratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states.

Yours sincerily, Alexandria    ",4
09da56a,"Over the years the amount of cars that have been manufactured have increased immensly. Cars help us get to place quicker by making less effort to get there. We no longer need to walk to go to the park or the mall which can take a long time. Although cars are very useful and fun to drive, it also has its risk like anything else on Earth. Which is why i think limiting car usage would be a great idea.

Most cars use gasoline or diesel as there fuel to get them going. This causes problems because the fuel that is burned pollutes the atmosphere and creates smog. Paris had this problem before. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer says that Paris had ""days of near-record pollution"" and they attempted to reduce it by applying a 22-euro fine ($31). As a result congestion in Paris was down 60 percent and the smog, as stated in the article, ""cleared enough for the French party to rescind the ban of odd-numbered plates"" Getting rid of the smog and having less air pollution would help not only the environment but i can also help us breathe oxygen easier. Limiting car usage can help us decrease pollution and increase breathable oxygen.

Limiting car usage can benfit us in many ways. It can reduce air pollution which not only helps us breathe better but it also helps the environment. It can also relieve stress. Everyone that drives a car knows how stressful it can be sometimes. Any traffic jam can turn a regular day to a stressful day. Hearing someone honking their horn, yelling ""Come on! Move already!"" and adding some unnecesary profanity can be very irritating. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky says that for the third straight year the city of Bogota have a car-free day called Day Without Cars. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" states the article. A lot of people actually participated in this event even thought it rained that day. The Mayor of Bogota Antanas Mockus said that even though it is raining it ""hasn't stopped people from participating"". It was a great idea to have a day like this to relax and not be stuck in traffic which is one reason why one businessman was happy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. It's a great event that should spread to the world. It will be very helpful to us and the environment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is very beneficial. It can relieve stress and reduce air pollution. It can also reduce car accidents which can decrease the number of deaths that occur in a car accident. If you're on a budget, limiting the the amount of time you use your car can help you save gas money. It can also help you excercise a little. Since you aren't using a car you have to use a different form of transportation like walking or riding a bike. These are just a few advantages that limiting car usage have. Limit your car usage, it can help you and the environment.    ",4
09e6583,"The Facial Action Coding System being applied for a student in the classroom can lead to many benefits and improvements in the classroom. This system could be applied in way that help develop the learning and how to teach the student to be more interactive in the classroom. Ways that this Coding System can be used to improve students in a classroom in that the System can determine whether or not a student is interactive in the class, if a student is cheating or lying, or whether things outside of school are affecting/bothering the student.

One way that this Facial Action Coding System can benefit the teacher and student is whether or not the student is interactive in the class. If the Facial Action Coding System were to take pictures of the student throughout the class and see what kind of emotions students are experiencing throughout the class, this could actually help the teacher. For example, if the student shows expressions of happiness throughout the class, then the teacher should continue her approach of learning, because happier student tend to be more interactive in the class. If the Facial Action Coding System were to analyze students feeling disgust or sadness throughout the class, this would be beneficial for the teacher in that this implies the teacher needs to change their approach and if the teacher were to question the student, how and what they (the teachers) can do to allow the students to be more interactive. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (Huang, paragraph 6). This shows that even online learning could be changed using this Coding System and that using this technology would be beneficial throughout different kinds of learning systems and different kinds of students. Also, as I said before, if the Coding System is able to detect students feeling bored or becoming confused in class, it may lead to the teacher changing his approach on how to teach the lesson.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System could also be helpful in that the system could help teacher find cheaters and dishonest students in the class. An example of this is that if the Facial Action Coding System were to detect fear or surprise if a teacher confronts a student on cheating, this will help the teacher on deciding if the teacher actually cheated or whether the student was actually innocent. Also if the student decides to lie and fake an happy expression, the machine would also be able to detect this. This author states the system is able to detect a fake expression when he states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus makes crow feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the smile is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; thes muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (D'Alto, paragraph 8). This quote shows that the machine to detect a faked expression and if the student is lying or faking an expression, the teacher will be able to call him out on it using the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Coding System could also detect whether things outside of school is affecting him and whether or not the student need help. For example, if the student were constantly to have a sad and fear expression throughout the school, the counselor/principal may be able to ask the student what is going on and why the student constantly is feeling this type of way. The counselor/principal may discover things that could be traumatizing to the student and proceed to get the studen help or aid.

In conclusion, having a Facial Action Coding System may be beneficial for both the student and the teacher in a classroom. With this system, teachers are able to identify whether they should change the way the way they teach the class, if a student is faking an expression when caught cheating or lying in the classroom, and if something is concerning a student outside of school. All of these reasons prove that schools should start implementing this new system into their technology such as video cameras, computers, and tablets. ",4
09e971b,"There will be many different opinions over weather or not we should use this technology in class rooms. The Facial Action Coding System has positive and negative sides. It could be enjoable. There is also a chance that it could just be a complete and utter fail. Though, are the benifits of students worth the negative aspects of this new technology?

If this new system were applied to our schools, students would be more likely to enjoy what they are participating in. The students would have been matched to their own personal work while still accomplishing what they need to be able to pass. Maybe students would not dread school as much as they do now. Instead of losing interest in their studies, students could enjoy learning. If students began learning on their own because they enjoyed it so much, maybe they would also take up their own studies. Could you imagine how advanced our future would be if people were actually passionate about learning?

On the other hand, some people would see the Facial Action Coding System as an invasion of privacy. They would think that what little personal life they had left was being stripped from them. Or maybe we could even be being watched all the time and not just when we are aware of it. People are already so paranoid about everything. So why not just throw in always being observed like government projects.

Some people would say this fancy new system is just to expensive. Maybe even a waste of money that could be used for something more necessary and useful. People would debate an argue over what is best and the arguing would be a waste of time all on it's own. Everyone has their own opinion. Everyone wants to be heard.

It may just be easier to save the money. Though you will never know what you are missing out on until you try. So, why not try to apply this program to the schools. It could be a huge success. We could have a completly new and updated experience of life. If mankind has gotten this far without it, could you imagine where we would be with it? ",4
09fc519,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an excellent idea. It would allow schools to make classes more enjoyable for students. Teachers would know if the students are understanding the lessons. Teachers could know if students are stressing and help them calm down. The software would help provide better data for researchers. The program would benefit both students and teachers. It would also make getting data for research easier.

With the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. The program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" The F.A.C.S could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

The software could help researchers collect better data faster. Researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. They could just take it from the program directly. This could help them improve the technology and make it more efficient. The information would help in other studies regarding schools or students. It could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

The F.A.C.S would make the classrooms of schools better. They could make students safer. The schools could receive better feedback on what works and what does not. Researchers would get better information for studies. The systems would benefit more than just one. ",4
0a01969,"Technology is constantly changing and adapting with the times. Some people fear change and loss of control with autonomous technology, especially cars; however, technological control can actually improve the safety of driving in the future. Driverless cars will help to improve the quality and safety of driving around the world.

Driving safety is a prevalent issue in many parts of the world. People face daily dangers on the road, such as texting drivers, drunk drivers, and drivers that are too exhausted to focus; with autonomous cars, these dangers would be removed. The driverless cars would use multiple sensors to form continuously updated 3-D models of the car's surroundings, which would allow the car to substitute for a human at the wheel. Critics might argue that it is unsafe to rely purely on technology to drive people.

However, the cars would not be purely autonomous; the car would alert the human driver if he or she needed to take over. Several large car companies, including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan, are already planning to release cars that are capable of driving themselves by 2020. Rapid technological improvements are allowing cars to become more refined and to take over multiple tasks that were originally done by human drivers. These cars and their sophisticated technology vastly improve the safety of driving on the road.

Driverless cars would not only improve safety on the road, but would also improve the safety of the environment. Currently, cars use up millions of gallons of gas each year, causing pollution and severely impacting the quality of air in many city environments. However, autonomous cars could be used as replacements for current taxi systems. Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, believes that the use of driverless cars in place of taxis would greatly reduce the amount of air pollution as well as the consumption of gasoline; the cars would use half the amount of fuel that taxis currently consume. Driverless cars would improve the safety of the world.

It has been proven multiple times that these cars will improve the safety of driving around the world; unfortunately, the road to driverless cars is still blocked by laws and by people's fears. If people allow it, autonomous technology in cars will have a huge positive impact on the future.",4
0a0d3b4,"The Face is a natural landform and not an alien monument. On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.

Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Also, NASA showed the image for all to see, and the caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The answer is yes the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon.

But, few of us scientists believe the Face is an alien artifact. On April 5,1998, scientist, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Face to prove there was no alien monument. When the Face image was finally posted, anxious web surfers saw that it was revealed as a natural landform and no alien monument at all. Everyone wasn't satisfied. Skeptics were saying that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.

On April 8, 2001, we drew clse enough for a second look. One scientist said, ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A scientist, Gavin, once said "" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

The Face is just a natural lanform and not alien monumument at all. I think this because we all have taken pictures and used evidence as to why the Face isn't an alien monument. I hope everyone agrees with me and all the other scientists because the proof that we've given is reasonable.                       ",4
0a238c3,"Driverless cars have been in all of our minds since television and moives have put them there. Google has had driverless cars since 2009, but are they safe to be in one. While haveing a driverless car seems epic it does have some downfall to it. Driverlesss cars , or smart cars, are a bad idea because it cost a large amount of money, a driver must be on the wheel and on alert at all times, and it even has problems with the law.

Driverless cars in the late 1950s had to run on a special track. The smart-road systems worked well. It was actully a succesful test, but it would have require massive upgrades to the existing roads. The roads would be too expensive to upgrade. So instead of smart-roads they moved on to smart cars. The smart cars would need a lot of sensors to work. The senors would of course become more advance, but so well the cost.

Although the smart cars cost a large amount it also still needs a driver at the wheel. The car can handle speeds up to 25mph, but the sensors make sure the dirver hold on to the wheel. Even though it is a smart car none of the cars can go without a driver at the wheel. The car would need a driver for roads it can't navigat thourgh. Such as work zones and around accidents. The car can not navigat thourgh these places which is why it alerts the driver that the need to take control of the wheel. To improve this the manufacturers put cameras in the smart car to watch driver. They make sure that the driver is focused on the road. If there is a road the car needs help with, it would vibrate the seat to alert the driver.

Even if the car can alert the driver the law focus on on how focused the driver is. In some states it is illegal to test a computer-driven car. Such states worry the the car would cause an accident to the passengers, and pedestrians. If the traffic laws change it would still need to cover liability of the accident. So if the car fails and caused an accident would the driver or manufacturer be at fault.

So in the end driverless cars are a horribly idea. They would cost a large amount of money. As well as they are not actully driverless and needs someone to be there, and they are agist the law at some states. Driverless cars should just stay in television and moives.",4
0a31cd0,"The UNNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hires Seagoing Cowboys to take care of animals that are being shipped overseas. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to take care of all the animals every day. In the text it states that the animals have to be fed and watered about two or three times a day.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it opens your range of knowledge about the world, so you can learn so much about people's culteres and style, but if you don't like learning about the world there is a lot of time to socialize with your freinds or make new freinds. Luke Bomberger the longest person to be a Seagoing Cowboy at that time states ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportuninty for a small-town boy.""

Though being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun there still are struggles you have to get pass. Luke Bomberger on night watch went to go down to the captin about the hourly report (if you are the night watchman

you have to do a hourly report on the animals) and while he was going he sliped on a slipery ladder an went feet first to an edge of the ship where he could fall off into the dark icy alantic ocean, but luckily a strip of metal along the edge stoped his slide, but he broke his ribs and couldn't work for a few days.

If someone joins it might be the most thrilling part of their adventure of life. When Luke was done he said ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""",4
0a48500,"Have you ever heard of the facial action coding system? The facial actions coding system enables computers to identify human emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Pretty cool,right? But is this technology really valuable for students in a classroom? I'm going to give you three reasons as to why i think this technology is not valueable.

Firstly, students have a right to keep their privacy. it might be very embarrasing for a student that wants to keep their emotions private to later find out that teachers know exactly how they feel. Even though by just looking at somebody you can whether someone is happy,sad,mad,and etc. If someone doesn't feel comfortable with their emotions they can seek the help they need. Students might not want to attend school anymore due to the fact that their privacy has been taken away, and at any second they might be questioned about their emotions.

secondally, students attend school to learn. By cutting precious timeout of their day to try and read their emotions many students will not get the learning that is needed. Students will start to get bad grades and fail many classes if they are not learning the right way. Many parents might get upset, because they might not want the their kids to go through this process. If the teachers have the parents permission that would be a whole different story.

Lastly, Many students already go through stress due to having many school assignments and trying to keep their grades in good shape. If teachers put another stress factor on kids it could be very hard on them, and also could lead to depression. This generation if very private with everything that goes on in their daily life activities. I know students will not like everyone knowing about how they all are feeling everyday. Students deserve to be happy or sad without everyone knowing.

This are my three reasons as to why i feel that the facial action coding system is not valueable to students in a classroom. They need privacy, not having many stress in their lifes, and lastly they need their learning time.",4
0a54018,"I accept driverless cars entirely and base my position on statistics found both within and outside of the passage: ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"". The facts I base my opinion and position on driverless cars are: all of the accidents the Alphabet (formerly Google's vehicle) Driverless Passenger Mobile Vehicle were caused by human drivers alone. The second reason is because the vehicles have instant, high speed, and highly accurate radius road mapping systems to navigate safley for both the passengers and other drivers and passengers.

I very much disagree with the sentence found in the passage: ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009"" in paragraph 2 because there are very few conditions that the vehicle could ever function under even in the 2009 model's developed.

I also disagree with the first line in the passage which states: ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cards because no one needs them anymore?""; although specifically ground vehicles that match the appearance of cars may be unavailable for direct transportation, most humans will rely on some form of direct vehicular control as the human inovation proccess brings more variety to forms of transportation, there will always be a time gap between the development of self controlling functions in vehicles and the manufacturing of the vehicles themselfs. We will move on, but we will always at some point be in control of some transportation directly as we progress through the newer types of transportation such as recycleable aerospace vehicles and extra-atmospheric transportation manufactured by SpaceX.

To conclude, I believe that taking the step to accept driverless vehicles as they are in post-testing phases is a healthy and natural nessesity for humans to take to allow for greater inovation as it is manufactured. Driverless vehicles are proven to be safer and are heavily misunderstood. Most of the government organizations that take time away from proper conduct of ensuring the safety of drivers with improved motor ways on the world to focus on neglecting innovation and progression of mankind lack the basic leading skills they are required to have to allow for better and newer mechanics.",4
0a62a7a,"For many years, the automobile has become and remained a staple in the world as humanity's most popular choice of transportation. The number of cars manufactured by car companies has reached the hundreds of millions. Cars have been a trademark of American ingenuity and the evolution of technology. However, as we go into the great beyond that is the future, we must take into consideration the pains and risks of these vehicles, and if they are worth driving as the world population exceeds seven billion.

Few people can recall a time where global warming wasn't the main conflict of scientists today. The Earth gets warmer as pollution levels rise as smog around cities like Paris and Mexico City reaches an all time high. The polar caps are melting at a rapid rate as hurricanes ravage the mainland harder and harder each year. What caused this stuff to happen? Why, look no further than our friends, the factories and automobiles! These two have been quoted time and time again as the catalyst of the global warming crisis. With such an adverse effect on the ozone layer, governments around the world have to do something to stop it from rising any further, with nothing short of success. Places like France have realized the extreme rise in smog levels in the city of Paris, that they had to do something. So, they made a ban on driving for people with even numbered license plates with only a few exceptions, and banned odd numbered licensed cars the next to try to curtail this occurance. After a few days, it worked. The smog cleared just enough for the French government to rescind its ban on license plates for the city. Such a huge difference in smog in only two days means that making a ban similar to this could be nothing short of beneficial for communities around the globe. So why don't more communities take up the hard task of making this ban a regular happening? It's a slow process, but it is happening, in unlikely places. Including over in our Western European ally Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a small community town located near the border of France and Switzerland. This town is best known for it's extremely unorthodox method of removing greenhouse gases from the ozone layer. People have decided to give up their cars, just relying on other transportation like walking and taking a local tram. Street parking, driveways and home garages are just not allowed in the district, and this has caused a huge difference between non-car owners and car owners alike. Seventy percent of the population in Vauban does not own a motor vehicle, a large portion of them sold their cars to move out to this small, cozy little town. Busy sidewalks and the chatter of civilians outshines the faint murmurs of the few odd automobiles in the city. What started out as an odd social experiment has turned into a great community full of happy people. Although this type of community is generally unpopular, other countries around the world have come to like the idea Vauban came up with. The capital city of Colobia, Bogota, has a neat program they like to call the Day Without Cars. The title speaks for itself. Civilians would take one day out of the year to generally not use cars, to promote the likening of taking other modes of transportation to wherever you need to go. Countries in South America have noticed this day, and are looking to replicate it themselves, which ultimately signifies the success of the Day Without Cars.

Countries around the world have all tried to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, whether by making a community built around the non-use of cars, making a day celebrating the use of other modes of transportation, or just banning the driving of automobiles outright. As just of a cause it may be, Americans are still hesitant to enact such henious laws. However, if more communities are built around this clean idea, more and more people will flock to it. It just takes preserverence, a strong plan, and a whole lot of sidewalks.    ",4
0a7fbd0,"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satifyied with the whole process. Show we ""abolish"" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesnt matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winner-take-it-all basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College (301 and 370 elector votes exactly). When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter.       ?????????????       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",4

This software is the lastest invention from Prof. The six basic emotions humans have can be read or showed by this Facial Action Coding System. This new technology is being tested to see if it is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of students. I belive this tecnology wouldn't be valuable in the classroom or learning enviroment. This technology doesnt benifit the students learning or relate to their school subjects.

Facial Action coding System can calculate human emotional expressions. It calculates how you feel or waht you are feeling. I don't think this software would be valuable in the classroom because it is invading the kids personal space. Having the teachers or the computers always knowing how you feel is creepy. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Simle"" it states that humans perform this task or calculation of reading people's emotions everyday. The artical also states that humans most likly can tell how otheres or how their friends are feeling by looking at their faical expressings. Having Facial Acton Coding System in the classroom would just be unessasary and invading others personal space.

This software or technology only reads humans emotional expressions, it does'nt teach anything or help people learn anything benifiting to school. If this technology was to be put into classrooms it wouldnt be benifiting to the kids or teaching them anything related to their school work. The artical states that the computer would be able to tell when a student is confused or bored while doing a leason. Most schools don't even teach leasons on the computer a teacher teaches them the leason they are learning. Also some kids or even their parents wouldn't want a computer to be reading their childrens emotions 24/7, also the students may not want to be monitored all the time aswell. This technology just isn't benificial to the learning enviroment in that sort of way.

The software update, the Facial Action Coding System is cool on how it reads humans emotions and tells you how they are feeling, but it just isn't valuable to classrooms or the learning enviroment. This software invades otheres person sapce by always monitoring their emotional expressions and calculating how u feel. Some people might find it creepy on the fact they are always being read by this new technology. This new technology isn't valuable to classrooms also because it it is not benifical to kids learning. The Facial Action Coding System doesnt teach kids realting to their school subjects. Teachers teach the leasons and not computers this software would'nt be nessarsy in classrooms.                                                    ",4
0a9df6a,"Have you ever been in a car accident or close to one ? Do you remember if it was your fault or not? What if it wasn't ? There have been talk about driverless cars , and with these cars there would still be need of driver assistance. These cars could cause numerous accidents. Would they still be your fault? If you got in one of these ""driverless cars"" you would be accountable for any damage done because you were supposed to be alert while riding in this driverless car.The development of driverless cars should cease because the car still needs human assistance,the car is not safe and the car weakens drivers alertness.

Driverless cars are not what they seem,false advertisement, you still have to drive them at some point. An article says that these cars are unable to direct through traffic or pull out of drive ways, the complicated things. If the car unables the driver to get out of doing the complicated work ,why have one ? The article also states the car is supposed to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Drivers do not need another human to take the wheel they can do it themselves, drivers need advanced technology to take the wheel , because all humans make mistakes, technology does not. Driverless cars are not good on highways because what if there is an accident on the highway and the driver is not alert, the car does not know how to detour its way around.Driverless cars are supposedly good on ""smarter roads"" , not every road is a smart road. What are people who live in congested city and construction

areas supposed to do? The driverless car is not a good product , it is obviously useless to most people because of the rules and regulations with this car.

Think about your life ,who would you blame for an ingury if you had a driverless car mishap? Certainly not yourself one would hope, driverless cars are extremely dangerous if you think about it , the inventers, google, thought of this car. The car is supposedly to be driverless but it is not, the car requires human assitance from time to time.In a case of a driver falling asleep and not hearing the alert of the car could result in a major incedent .The warnings google came up with to alert the drivers were vibrating seats, and flashing windshields that can not be seen if a driver is asleep. If a driver gets in one of these cars and then gets in a non-driverless car they will be left feeling that that can just fall asleep at the will and this will cause more problems.

Driverless cars will weaken a drivers alertness and decrease the probablity that they will stay focused enough to get behind a wheel when it is needed.Drivers need to be alert regardless if they are driving or not , because another driver in another car could not be alert and that could result in an accident.

Realizing this makes people wonder if there will one day not be a purpose for a drivers license because techniacally they won't be driving. But with everyone just wanting to be in with the new things in the world no one ever thinks about some of the dangers self driving cars could cause.

One danger people should be extremly aware of is the independance on the vehicle. When people hear the phrase Self Driving Cars they think about something completely different and more advanced than what driverless cars actually are. They instantly assume that they have a free ride to where they want to go and can be oblvious of there surroundings when thats not the case at all. What if there is a malfuction and they have to be ready to take the wheel to keep from drving into a ditch and they arn't. As stated in the article it says ""..the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation comes."" this means that even though people are not driving doesn't mean they can sit on their phone text and expect there not to be any problems because they can't be so dependant on a machine.

Another problem there is with getting the driverless car on the road is the laws that need to be passed to allow them. only three state have allowed them to begin driving on the roads which are ""California,Nevada and Florida"" but even those states keep them on minimum useage for acident prevention. As stated in the article ""..even if traffic law change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" which means that there would be conflicts between owners and manufacturers to see who would be responsible if there were accidents caused by malfuctions.

Now there is a diiference between self driving and autopilot. with autopilot people still understand this as you have to be cautious if though they arn't driving they still have to steer. As stated ""Tesla has projected a 2016 reaease for a capable of drivihng atuopilot 90 percent of the time"" this says that even though it's not self drving you can still drive with little to no driving at all.

Even though it would be cool to have a self drivng car people still need to put safety of themselves and others before buying a driverless car.",4
0acfeeb,"The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged, as well as ""faithless"" electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.

In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. This cannot represent the will of the people.

Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards ""swing states."" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.

The Electoral College dosen't hear the voice of the people, hardly plays by the rules, is something that should be erased. Even people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dale, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree, give the voice back to the people and abolish the Electoral College!    ",4

One reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote instead of the Electoral College is because the states aren't all equal and electoral college isn't fair. In the Electoral College, California has more of a say than Georgia. California has 55 electoral college, while Georgia has 16. How is that fair?

Say there was a candidate campaigning, they will most likely focus on the states that have the most electoral college, like California or Texas. They won't go to states that only have three votes. That's not fair to the states that have a small population. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 6). If electoral votes wasn't a thing, Gore would be president. He's the candidate that won most popular votes, meaning that he got the most votes in the nation. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). Not always? What's the point of voting if the vote won't even count?

Another reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote is because the popular vote will be more precise and it's much easier. There could be less ties, and the candidate that everyone really wants as president will become the president. ""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 16). Gore was the candidate that everyone wanted as president. It just doesn't seem fair that the candidate that won popular vote, isn't or wasn't the president.

Overall, the people should change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States instead of using a system that is unfair to the states and the people.    ",4
0af56e8,"This technology to read the emotions and expressions of students in the classroom would be very helpful. Most of the time humans can't tell what a person is feeling and how they will act. With this new technology it could figure out how your emotions are and it could help out the teachers in a classroom to teach a lesson differently based on how some students are expressing their emotions. a person cant read muscles inside a persons face, only a computer can do that and that is what is so amazing about this new technology is that it can do stuff that a person can not do.

This technology could help teachers in the classroom or coaches working on film or a business, to see how all of their workers or their students are reacting to all that is being thrown at them. this benefits the teachers mostly because society has changed so much and alot of stuff is done on computers and they teach alot of lessons off of computers and in the text it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means that whenever a student is sitting there learning the lesson and something comes up and they are very confused they may make a face of confusion and the computer will read that face and the teacher could know how the students felt about the lesson based on the results that the computer came up with when the students were learning the lesson. From there she could help certain students figure something out or teach them an alternative way because now she knows that some kids dont get the material. With this new technology she is able to figure out who is getting the material and who is not and before, she could not figure out if a student was having trouble with the material or not because most of the time students dont speak up and say anything when they are confused because they feel like they are the only ones who are having trouble but with this technology they dont even have to say a word they can just express their emotions and the computer will pick it up. With this new technology it knows what a fake expression is and what is not a fake expression do to the muscles inside your face. In the bottom of paragraph seen it says ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This means that there is no faking out of the lesson, you either understand it or you dont and there is no slipping past it with this new technology.

In the end it makes it easier for alot of people when considering that this technology can do things that people cannot do. It will make it easier on teachers and on the students because the computer is telling the teacher how the students react to the material that is being thrown at them. the students will feel the way they feel and there is no hiding that anymore with this new technology.

0afe6a6,"In everyday life, students go through a rollar coster of emotions with only few known of. They become happy on a sunny day or become upset after not doing so great on a test. Many emotions can be seen on the face but, students have learned to keep those emotions well hidden with the intention of not wanting anyone to know or find out. Technology being able to determine students' emotion would be extremely benefitial in helping the student fell better and being able to share their emotions.

Using devices to read our emotions would help frowning students smile more when they need it. The computer would be able to read their face by seeing the facial movements and determine whether a student is becoming bored in class. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, having a computer that can read emotions in class "" could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto 6). This could improve the student's learning skills and can help the teacher be notified when and where a student needs help.

This technology would not only be benefitial in the student's school life, but also in his or her personal life too. Computors would be able to see if a student was truely unhappy or upset and would be able to help in a way a human could not. The student may not want anyone to know of their sadness, but a computor knowing is harmless. Depending on the mood, "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto 6). With this technology, when someones is upset, something happy and encouraging could pop up and make them smile. This could brighten a student's mood and encourage them to keep working with a better attitude going out than going in.

The ability to know how someone is feeling without them having to say it could make it easier for people to jump in and help each other out. If one student sees another who was putting on a fake smile, they may be able to encourage them or say something nice to put a real smile on their face. Theory of Emotion, ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses the emotions, but may even produce them"" (D'Alto 9). Putting a smile on someone's face, even for a second, can truely make a difference. This technology would be extremly valuable a student's academic life, to help them to do their best and succeed, and in their personal life, to be more of a light to others.    ",4
0b0644a,"I beileve driverless cars could be a good thing, but need to be throughly tested, even over tested. This isn't some new smart phone, or game system, this is something that can kill someone, even a whole family if the proper precautions are not put in place. As the article says bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays is an excellent way to keep fellow drivers safe of the road, and the sensors on the top of the vehicle looks to be a great tool for safety as well.

With any technology campany, its always about who has the smarter devices, and who can get them out the fastest. I get it, its all apart of marketing, I know. But this is something that shouldn't be sprinted into, this is an advanced, futuristic idea that should not be rushed to the public, but added on, enhanced, and decorated that on theories, but real systems keeping real people safe.

I also can't help to wonder, can these cars go on more narrow, country, or even alley roads? Living in a small town the only normal roads are those that lead of of town and threw it, but all its branches of smaller, and country roads severely out-number the others. Will it mostly go to city people, who have the proper roads, or will it go the small-town people who would have to keep their hands on the steering wheel most of the time?

Another questioned I'd want to ask is with such a relaxing driving experience, what procedures does the car follow when a driver fall asleep? Does it shock him/her, or play loud music, simply say, ""wake up"", or nothing at all? The article mentioned that the smart car GM has come up with, vibrates the seat when about to be backed into an object, could something like that be put into play?

I think the idea and prototypes that are being made about smart cars are a good thing, a smart thing if you will. But I still have my doubts, questions, and worries. But if smart cars can advance to the point without those worries, we could be looking at an entirely new era.            ",4
0b23a57,"I think that sometimes it would be good to use FACS, but at the same time, it would also be smart to not use it all the time. FACS is a Facial Action Coding System that detects the way someone is feeling. It can tell if you are feeling sad, happy, energetic or tired, just by your actions. I think we should only use it if we HAVE to, otherwise, just use our human instincts and look at each other to tell how one another is feeling.

I believe we should use FACS if it is a necessity. If someone is showing signs or actions that are just merely impossible to interpret, then yes, we should use FACS. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" says Dr. Huang. If someone is just smiling kind of broadly, like the article tells us, and not really showing us if they are smiling or not, I believe that is a time that we should use FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Some people though, think that we should not use it, and I agree with them just a little bit.

When should we not use it? I think times that we should not use it are when it is easy to tell the way someone is feeling, or if someone has a medical problem that would be affected by this. We also should not use this if you are at home. I know that in today's age, most homes probably don't have a PC that hooks into the wall anymore. Nowadays, most homes just have a laptop that everyone will share, and they will call it a home computer. Either that, or most people probably just have their own personal laptops. What I am trying to say though, is that we should not use it at home because as the article say, a home PC could not handle the complex algorithms that FACS requires.

Now, if you are one of those people who are somewhere in the middle, you don't know if we should use it or not, I would say just look at how it works. All FACS does, we as human can pretty much do ourselves. It just takes movements that you do, and then says what it thinks your emotion is that you are feeling. But, if you think about it, we can do that do as humans. So, there might be one reason that you start leaning more towards not using it. You might start to think again though if you think about what i said earlier. If someone is smiling broadly, we can't really tell how they are feeling. So, that might be a time that you would say use it.

Now, even after looking at all of this information, I will probably always be one of those people who just don't know if it would be good or not to use it. If you don't, then you would just use your human instincts and try to tell what someone is feeling. You might just be one of those people who likes to do everything old school. If you do, then that must mean you just don't want to try to tell what someone is feeling. This could be laziness, but who knows. Maybe that is a time that you should use FACS. ",4
0b2bfc4,"This artical is about, FACS (Facial Action Coding System), which is a new software

that has been developed, it improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This computer software was made so a computer can detect your emotions to understand what you like and dont like. The author states that, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.""

I believe that we should use this process on computers at the schools, so that the computers better understand the schools students. The author states that, ""This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries."" This software can express many different emotions such as, happy, mad, sad, ect. It can also store infromation, as to what you like and what you dont like, by the way your muscles movwe in your face. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical infromation as electronic code."" It can also help a student if he/she is having trouble on the computer, it can do that by reading the emotions on your face by the way your facial muscles move in a certain way. The author states in paragraph 6 that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The author wrote the article, FACS (Facial Action Coding System), to help computers camunicate better with humans, by reading the way their muscles on their face move, or react, to express how humans feel. This new computer software would be a good thing to add to the schools computers, that way the computers can better communicate, and help, the students if they are confused or bored. Even if you have different face expressions, or mixed emotions. the auther says, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). Computers need to be able to better communicate with humans.",4
0b4df74,"Driverless cars are the future of the roads. They provide an easier way to get to and from different locations, and can help prevent deadly and dangerous accidents. With driverless vehicles, they would prevent wasting excess gas due to them being programmed to be economically efficient. It would also provide a less stressful enviroment for the passengers allowing them to not worry about getting lost due to the gps in the computer driven cars.

Driverless cars will help preserve the enviroment by not using excess gas. ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" A future with driverless public transportation would make the lives of people easier. Having driverless cars become a full on public-transport taxi systerm would help prevent the amount of non enviromentally friendly vehicles driven on a daily basis. Driverless cars with the use of sensors would prevent many car accidents and traffic situations if programmed correctly. ""Futher improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" There will be fewer traffic problems if driverless cars took over. There are companys working on improving how driverless cars handle traffic situations. ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Although driverless cars are not one hundred percent self driven, it is still good to allow the driver to take over when they want to or need to. WIth the addition to alerts and warnings telling the driver if the car needs to be manually controlled, it allows for a even safer enviroment. Once these ""smart"" cars have been proven safer, many states may soon open up to the use of the driverless car. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Caliornia, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have lead the country in allowing limited us of semi-autonomous cars; manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe.""

In conclusion driverless cars are the future of automobiles. The driverless cars provide a economic and enviromentally friendly aspect to the road. They will allow better traffic conditions and prevent more accidents. There will have to be certain laws that come into effect concerning driverless cars, but overall they would provide a safer, healthier enviroment for everyone. Once they have been proven as more reliably safe, driverless cars will begin to brighten the worlds future by bringing these positive aspects onto the road on a daily basis.",4
0b869b2,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valueable. It can help actors learn how to make a smile or frown look real, it can help a teacher figure out if a student needs more help just by scanning his or her face, and it can help us figure out what our friends are realling feeling.

First, movies are a big part of our life. It is never fun to go to watch a movie and see that the actors arent good they either look like they dont know what they are doing or they try looking sad and actually look like the happest person on earth. with this technology like the arthour says "" Drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". This shows that even just practicing a fake smile for a movie or for when you are on stage could make the play seem better than it already would be of the actors didnt know how to put on a real smile.

Facial action coding system can also be helpful in the class room so when you have a kid on the computer you can see if they are strugging and they need more help or if they are powering through it and need a bit more of a obsticle to go through. like in in the article "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confussed or bored...it could then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could help a teacher out cause they cant always tell of a student is having trouble. they also dont always see the when they are doing their work at home. This is like the teachers second hand man when coming to helping students get the help or challenge they need.

Lastly, you may have a friend that you cant tell if they are sad or happy because . The article states "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"". You never if a friend is putting on a fake smile to keep you from getting down, but thats just hurting them even more so you sometimes have to do things yourself and get them the help they need.

In conclusion, I believe that being about to see someones emotion just by scanning their face could be very helpfull to get kids the help they need or the challenge, helping a friend get through a rough time, and making movies better. ",4
0b88519,"Do you ever wonder why the world is becoming so much warmer by the minute? Not many people stop and realize what's the real problem. Us humans are the major problem in this situation, we don't see that we are taking what we have to an advantage. To our factories, cars, or even trash. The main one that is causing our greenhouse gases to rise is our Power plants, but following behind the power plants are vehicles. Cars have become a major impact in our lives, from hurting one another, to hurting the place we live on. Car-free cities are going to help make a big, helpful change in peoples lives.

In the city of Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Vauban is called a ""car-free"" place, cars aren't allowed on the streets of vauban. Many people sold their cars to live in vauban, all around vauban wants a healthy way of living. Vauban allows car ownership, but the cars are only to be parked in two places which are the garages. ""When I had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter said. It is a much healthier and less stressful way of living, new ideas will always come in handy. The United States Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car Reduced"" communities. Hopefully they get someone to tag along with this promotion, and get supporters to enforce it.

Bogota, Colombia is going on their third straight year of a ""Car Free"" city. They are wanting to reduce smog, so buses and taxis are permitted. ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Carlos Arturo claimed. There was a consequence to the ones who didn't follow the rules, which was a $25 fine that they had to pay each time. Eventually, Two other Cities in Colombia, Cali and Valledupar, latched on to the idea of a ""Car reduction."" You see many people walking, running, riding bikes or skateboarding. A lot of people like this new idea that people are going by,? it's an great way to step foward to save the earth and its problems.

Over time, Americans haven't been buying cars, driving less, and over years less people get their license. America is hitting its driving peak, The number of miles driven peaked in 2005 and then decreased signifigantly since then. Not many can afford a brand new car, or the insurance, most people are unemployed and dont work at all. Cars have been around for a long time, but over that time period it has caused major life impacting issues. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said mimi sheller. Many people aren't aware of this ""Car Free"" idea, which is an disadvantage.? If this idea was spread through televison, newspapers, or even social media many people will pick it up and take it into consideration.

In an overall sum up, it is better to live ""Car Free."" You wouldn't have to stress yourself out about gas prices, fixing your cars, or your world becoming a big ball of heat. If Transportation and power plants are the two major impacts in our lives, we need to knock one out. Until, we can get some second options on power plants our best choice is to forbid cars. We have many other options to get around our city, running, walking, riding bikes or etc. The ""Car Free"" idea is very creative, not many people would take inisuative to help make the world a better and safer place. With an exception of a few, buses and taxis will be there for long distance trips. Cars caused a huge impact on our lives, but hurting us and our home which we call earth. The business plan is ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey.""

Driverless cars will be very useful because the people of our country are getting more lazy as time goes by. There are many benefits and many concerns when it comes to driveless cars. Driverless cars should be used in the near future because they are benefical by their technology used, sensors, and functions.

The technology used for the driverless cars are very beneficial compared to an average car. When the article states, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This quote shows that the technology used for the driverless cars are very beneficial and above an average car. With the driverless car having sensors it can mimic the skill of a human at wheel which is a amazing.

Sensors are not new in technology. The sensors used for the driverless car are one of its many benefits. The article says, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" This quote shows that the use of sensors is more safer and leads to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

The driverless car's functions are out of this world. The driverless car for the most part can work well indepently, but may need the drivers help in certain situations. The article states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notfiy the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This shows that driverless cars have very important and benefical functions, but may need the drivers help in certain circumstances.

Driverless cars will be very benefical in the near future. There is a lot of debate between the driverless cars as to whether they should be used or not in the near future. The driverless car has its many pros and cons. The driverless car has many special qualities and should be improved to be used in the future.

0bb0bc1,"Transportation is a must in today's society, and car usage plays a big role in the subject. Limiting car usage has many advantages. Reduced usage of cars can help the enviroment in various ways. Less car usage can help citizens be less dependent on cars, and can be a great stress reliever for others.

The enviroment is a big part of the lives of people and needs to be taken care of. Cars are known for polluting the air and damaging the enviroment. One of the problems about the air pollution involves greenhouse gas emissions. In the article (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal), Paragraph 5 states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Smog is another issue due to car usage. Paris is a known city for smog. In the article (""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer), it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."", meaning that smog is a big problem in the enviroment. Air pollution can be reduced with limited car usage and can help the enviroment in which we live in. Being independent can be one of the many benefits of limited car usage.

Relying on car usage can put people at a disadvantage. Limiting car usage can help citizens become less reliant on automobiles. Paragraph 20 states ""BOGOTA,Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3, Andrew Selsky). There are many differents ways of using transportation without having to rely on car usage. Jobs and businesses can be accessible through many alternative choices of transportation. Source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states ""He and I have similar obsercations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk of take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" (paragraph 39). Different Transportaion routes, or options, gives a wider variety of getting somewhere. Limited car usage can help citizens be more independent with transportation. Limited Car usage can be a way of relieving stress.

Citizens believe that limited car usage gives them the advantage of relieving stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1, Paragraph 3). Reduced car usage can cause a fellow citizen to feel happier. Paragraph 35 of Source 4 says ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Citizens feel more connected with friends without the neccessity of car usage. Less Driving impacts the lives of citizens in a postive way.

Limited car usage can only be seen as an advantage, it brings out many positive things. Reduced Car usage is Enviroment friendly and reduces air pollution. Less driving is a better way of being independent and stress-free. The world can be a better place with limited use of automobiles.    ",4
0bbbed5,"Do you believe in aliens? I mean, do you honestly think that aliens are roaming around in our solar system? Some say yes, some say no. Do you believe that aliens created the Face of Mars? Let me tell you, they didn't. Aliens are not here & they didn't create this Face on Mars. Plenty of research is found to back it up too.

First, research has been concluded & done to prove that this is a natrual landform. In an article called 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' it states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web sit, revealing...a natrual landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Websites aren't enough for some people though.

Next, this face on mars simulates some landforms on Earth. Therefore, it would be a natrual cause that happened. It states in the article of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""What the picture actually shws is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.' says Gravin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" By reading this, it is making it clear that this landform is somewhat common. It stated that landforms such as the Face on Mars is common around the American West. If it can happen on Earth, why can't it happen in outer space?

On the other side, the ""Face on Mars"" has attracted a lot of attention, especially in the social world. It states in the article of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""The 'Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood Film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" People seem to think that they can believe everything they hear & see on television or on magazines or even in movies. Presenting us all with fake gossip & fake news is how these businesses get money. They know, one person will believe it, leading to thousands more. We tend to believe in the 'juicy' filled drama. Not everything you hear out in the world is true. I know, I'd rather believe real scientist, than businesses thirsty for money.

In conclusion, evidence from scientist (like me) from NASA is much for believable than Hollywood movies & headline magazines. There are no aliens. The Face of Mars just so happens to be a natrual landform.         ",4

The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for who you would like to win, you are voting for an elector who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for who we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there has also been a few fiascos.

This style of voting has been going on since the beggining, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electors; they are not reliable. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This right here proves that the electors don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electors anyways? ""Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" We don't even get to select our electors, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for who we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.

The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabatoge the election. What is stopping more poeple from this? Some electors refused to vote for who they said they would. ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who ""validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so 'without establishing a precedent.'""

Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.

In conclusion, more people are aginst the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Less people would have a problem with the election process and it would go a lot smoother.

0bc541d,"Being able to have a car that drives itself would be cool, right? Well, maybe not as cool as you think. Having a car that drives itself comes with many complications. These complications may include lack of safety, lack of total automatic driving, and lack of laws needed to operate a smart car.

The smart car is a nice invention, but with the lack of safety it isn't very smart to drive. The systems within the smart car may fail and cause the operator to be injured. Having the systems fail is the worst thing that could happen while driving a smart car. It may cause an accident if the smart car is not at it best quality. This lack of safety really worries me as a driver myself.

While the smart car appears to be able to drive without a driver, it can't. The smart car can operate on its own but it requires the operator to be fully alerted at all times because the car cant drive itself through certain situations. These include accidents and work zones, which would require the driver to take the wheel and drive through these situations. The driver would become bored while not driving and may even fall asleep do to the lack of action. It just seems way to dangerous to trust an ""automatic"", driverless car that isn't fully automatic nor driverless with my life.

Many states now don't even allow many smart cars to be driven. In order for these cars to be able to be on the streets many laws would need to be made or changed. Without laws just for these smart cars people would drive reckless. If no laws are put in place who will be held responsible for the failing of the systems in a smart car? "" New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident "". Laws are needed to drve these cars no matter the argument to keep us and those around us safe.

Do smart cars still seem cool? I'll leave that answer up to you, but take everything i have said into consideration. Smart cars may be the future, but the way they are now is too dangerous. There are too many complications including lack of safety, lack of automatic driving, and lack of laws needed to operate a smart car. So, is a smart car really smart?     ",4
0bfeec7,"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversable but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethura of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeveors.

To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will acumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumilative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says ""Green house gas emitions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emitions in the country."" America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas emitions to start with but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations? and some smart city planning. The benifits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.

Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. instead you can lesiurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now."" This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant ""where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown{ed} out the occasional distant motor."" This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would dissagre with such an environment.

Now traveling all the way across the world, from Germany to Columbia. These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogata -The capital of Columbia, they actually organize ""Car free days"" seven million people in Bogota alone participated in the event, violaters would even have to pay a $25 fine. According to Andrew Selsky, the author of Car Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogoto, ""[Even] the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration and it has great effects on the environment.

In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues. If people stay on track it will be easy, fun, relaxing and the Earth will be admired for many years to come.       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?        ?    ",4
0c02064,"In movies and televison, driverless cars have been featured as an invetntion for the distant future. Automakers have begun to attempt the creation of driverless cars. There have been creations close to the driverless car but not exactly what people have been wanting to create. Driverless cars are a pointless invention idea and should not be developed any further.

Companies should not continue to pursue the driverless car idea any longer. Google has tried since 2009 to make driverless cars and they have been close to making one. The cars that Google has made can, ""drive moe than half a milion miles wothout a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't fully driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"". The cars are not fully dirverless if they have to alert the driver to take over driving for a while through traffic. The driverless car should be independent and not need help from the driver on issues like traffic and pulling in and out of driveways. In 2013, BMW created a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" but not a driverless car, which is the goal not a car that can only help with traffic. Smart cars have lots of sensors that can help guide divers through difficult jams or passage ways but those sensors cannot function without some help from the driver. The smart cars made by BMW, ""steer, accelerate, and breake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" . Their cars are close to the function of a driverless car but still need more work to be done in order to be able to drive without humans. Since the cars today still have not been developed like the driverless car it is pointless to continue to try. Even though driverless cars can be helpful there are laws that prevent some people from driving them. It is proven that, ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars"" . Most states will not allow the testing of let alone the driving of driverless cars. If driving one of those cars is not even allowed, then what is the point of developing the project further? The driverless cars should not be created since barely anyone is allowed to use them. Even if there was a change in traffic laws, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"". There need to be new laws covering the case of an accident about whether the blame is on the driver or the manufacturer. These new laws that would be set will take up time and could cause lawsuits. The technology in the car could fail and the someone could be injured and there would be the question of who is at fault. If someones safety is at stake then the car should not be made at all.

The idea of making a driverless car should not be continued. The car is a pointless idea that does not seem to actually work and would fail. There have already been multiple attempts at making this car and all have come close but failed. The project should be ended and automakers should stop wasting their time on this car and focus on the other cars they make. ",4
0c09020,"You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The program will allow you to experience many different adventures and go to many unique and eccentric places. One time my friend, Don Reist, and I went to New Orleans after the Pacific War had ended. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and we headed to Greece with the cargo of 335 horses with enough oats and hay to feed them. That was my first order, and I had fun.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, such as myself. Besides getting to help others, I had the side benefit of getting to see Europe and China. When I first went to Greece, I saw the Acropolis. I had also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. See, there are many adventures you can take on side of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One time when I was going to China, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings always kept me busy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luckily for me, helping my aunt Katie out on her farm as a boy had prepared me for hard work, just not for the dangers of the sea. As another example, if you had the experience I did of helping on the farm you have been slightly prepared with hard work.

One dark rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot my feet torward an opening on side of the ship. The only thing keeping me from falling overboard into the deep, dark, and dangerous Atlantic Ocean was a small strip of metal along the edge. I was really happy to still be alive. But, I couldn't work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs. I'll admit it, there some dangers working as a Seagoing Cowboy. But, the people there really look after you, and they care about you.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Participating in the program opened up a whole new world for me. I am really grateful for the opportunity. The program helped make me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.                 ",4
0c2f27d,"I think

that driverless cars are a good idea for tjhe majority of the time, but there are some people who will try and abuse the power of a driverless car. There were many negatives to using a driverless car like who is at fault when a accident occurs or who would want to drive a driverless car. I will tell you my argument for why I strongly believe that driverless cars are not so much of a good idea.

For my frist reason evin if there are some catious drivers in the U.S. there are more uncatious drivers than catious drivers. If we have driverless smart cars then people will be put at more risk then when they were manually operating of their vehicle. Also what if a malfunction occurs and one or more drivers or pedestrians get hurt then, ""who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer?"" says the article and I would believe that the manufactuer would be at fault but one would say otherwise.

My next reason is that a lot of driving laws would be altered or changed and more laws would be added. That is a big time consuming process and development would change every year with new designs, and other things of the sorts. With changing or adding laws people will start to loose their intrest in the car and look for something new in a manually operated vehicle. Most people would try and say that it is worth the wait but why wait for new technology that could malfucntion without alerting the driver like it says in the article about the development of the driverless car.

My final reason is that it is a big waste of money and could hurt one or more if not developed with the right technology and the right safety percaution are taken. The article says that there would be considerations of flashing lights in the windshield and this could be a big hazard because it could possabliy blind the driver also it could distract on coming traffic. The reason this would be a big waste of money is because if one were to get in a accident then there driverless car is completely totaled and rendered useless. Also with all the new features that would be added the cost of the car would be doubled most likely so this would be a very exspensive purchase for most who even considered trying the new technology.

In conclusion I have said for the most part a driverless car is pretty useful in many ways, but if you think about the big key which is safety then you would have to reconsider your choice. Even with the fact the car will be equip with many ways to alert the driver when it is time for them to take control it would just not work with the safety standards of most people. So really it all falls back on safety, so this is why I strongly believe that driverless cars are not a good idea.               ",4
0c385a8,"Dear Senator

In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this contery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the magority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an acurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter. Now the question is acked, What is the point of voting if it does not matter who we vote for only the Electoral College votes matter??       ?       ?    ",4
0c4ede2,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author gives us positive information and negative information. Different people are going to have different opinons on driverless cars. Some may think it is a good idea while some may think that it is a bad idea. There is no right or wrong answer. It is based on your personal opinion on what you think of driverless cars. I believe that it is kind of dumb to have driverless cars. There are many bad things that can happen with them such as safety hazards, unattentiveness while driving and accidents that may occur with them.

Driverless cars are not a good idea to me. When you drive you always have to be attentive. Driving is already not the safest thing in the world. There is always people walking out in front of you, animals running out in front of you and many other things. If you get a car that can drive for you there is bound to be something bad to happen. A computer is all that the car is. Computers go down all the time in the world and they shut down. What if your car happened to stop working in the middle of the highway where the speed limit is seventy-five miles per hour. There would be many accidents happening if that was the case. There is a positive thing about them though they can help you if you have children in the backseat. If they are acting up and you put your car on autopilot then you can get them to quit arguing. But still it is a very dangerous idea. No way would I trust a car to be able to drive me places when I barely trust myself driving me places. So I don't believe that these cars are one hundred percent safe. I think that there are many safety hazards that they could bring.

I also think that driveless cars are a bad idea because no matter what you have to be attentive. If you look away to the side for three seconds and your driving, your car is already the that side of the road. I believe that if there is going to be television and stero systems in these cars, that people are not going to be paying attention to the road, they are going to be paying attention to the televsion or whatever may be on in theirr car. When I drive I listen to the stero and it distracts me when a good song comes on. I could not imagine what I would be like if I had a television in my car. The good side about these driverless cars with televsion in them is that if you are going on a long road trip with your family and you want to watch televison you could. I know that when I take long road trips I wish that I could bond with the person that is driving. So it would be a good thing for families that had little ones. If the little kids were getting cranky then they could cuddle up next to mommy or daddy or whoever may be driving. But again the driver would not be attentive or aware of there surrroundings if that was to happen. They would probably fall asleep if they were relaxing to much and dozed off.

Finally I believe that these cars can cause many highway or country road accidents. For example, if a family was watching a movie and their was a sudden stop on the road they are most likely going to run right into that person in front of them. If it is a sudden stop there is no way a computer can see that and slam on the brakes. If it could do that though, the person behind the car would probaly get ran into. Like I have said in the beginning all this car is, is a computer. I mean my computer goes down so many times in a day. I would not rely on a computer made car for the life of me. There are already so many accidnets that happen when people are driving, there is no need to add a computer made car and let it make accidents to. I think that for a car to be completely driverless or ninty percent driveless is ridiculous. On the plus side of this if a car that was driveless did happen to work then it would come in handy for long trips on the road. If there was a actual car that got tested and it could go on for hundreds of thousands of miles and not wreck now that would be pretty amazing. But in my opinon I do not think that there is a car that is capable of being able to do that. A car takes human assistance to drive and if it all technology no way could it work effectively. There is going to be accidents if cars become ninty perfect driveless or any percent driveless

This concludes my opinion on driveless cars. I think that they would be a very neat invention but I do not believe for one second that they would work all the tie one hundred percent. I have been driving for a year now and have already been in accidents because I was not paying attention. So I know that being a human and driving is already complicated enough, I do not believe that a computer could handle it. I know that companies are trying their best to make this become an actual thing in the world but I don't think that it is belivable. I think that they could make them, I just do not believe that they would work that great. I am with the idea that there is no way

driveless car is even imaginable. So with the facts I have presented here I am sticking to my topic that driveless cars are the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard of. ",4
0c88bb6,"It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keeps things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or elect a horrible president, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes put in to elect a president.

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states ""other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president""(Posner,19). The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearences but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try tp evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy.    ",4
0d0a0cb,"In 1976 a surveyor caught a absurd picture coming from the face of Mar's planet. By face, it was literally a face. NASA didn't know how to explain but with the explanation that it was a mesa or some other landfiorm on the surface. Is it or is it not? Many people think its aliens, but let's look at the big picture. There is pure evidence that what you're seeing is a landform and I have some examples.

After close survey of the "" face "" NASA has concluded that what we are seeing is a mesa. In the text it says, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa-landforms common in the American West."" That is proof that scientists who specialize in this wwork confirm that what we are looking at are just mesas or buttes.

But really if there was aliens on MArs then we would've seen some evidence by now. If aliens built this then why didn't we see any tracks or signs that the aliens built this thing. NASA has taken photographs of the moon and Mars many times. In those times if there was alien life then I would think that their would be some sort of sign that leads us to believe that we are not alone.

Everyone knows that the alien theory is just fun in games. People just let those kinds of pictures out mainly for the enjoyment of the people. In the text it says, "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" That shows that NASA just released this photo so that the people would have some entertainment theorizing what this is.

Another big piece of evidence was shown in this story. In the text it says, "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cyodnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Thats the sole cause. It was just a mesa that was photographed at the right time. If the shadows weren't there then it would just look like a regular mesa on Mar's surface. Also if you look in that picture you will see other mesas or landforms surrounding it. So that tells you that that area is full of landfroms.

In conclusion, there is so much evidence showing that this was just a landform. And if you still believe that thi is aliens then you need to look at the facts. Aliens might be real but we need to find evidence that they did this before we go and say that they did. Based on evidence we can conclude that this picture is of a mesa taken at the right time to where it looks like a face. ",4
0d0b940,"As the world develops and time goes forward, technology is advancing by the year. From cell phones to gaming devices, every piece of technology is getting better and better. One piece of technology is also getting better as years go on, and that is space techonolgy and transportation. NASA has created an idea to be able to live close to the hosstile conditions of Venus; in which, people would live on blimp-like vehicle over the planet itself. Venus's climate and terrain might be an issue to the growing pursuit that people and companies (like NASA) are making towards travilling to Venus. That's not to say that the study and travel towards the planet can have pros and cons.

The weather on Venus is more perilous than anything we could think about on Earth. In paragraph 3 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states, ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" With the facts of how dangerous it is on Venus, it is insane to think of anyone who would want to travel to and study the planet of Venus.

On the other hand, NASA and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" think the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph 4 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.."" While the conditions of our neighboring planet, Venus, seem to outweigh the history of the symetry that our planets once were; exploration and the study of Venus might be a worthwhile cause.

Even without the traveling to Venus, companies and astrologist can still learn a great deal about the atmosphere of Venus without putting their lives at risk. In the concluding paragraph of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus,"" the author breifly talks about how studying the planet of Venus can benefit the intellingence of our world. The author states in paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author's opinion in the article could possibly be spot-on. With the challenges of trying to gain access to Venus's surface, the United States, as well as several other countries, have expanded their technological advances.

With everything being said and done, exploration and the studying of Venus has major pros and cons. The pros being that with the challenge of Venus's surface, technology has advance to the point where one day, humans may be able to travel to the hostile planet. the cons of course being the temperature, pressure, terrain, and atmospher of the planet we are so desperately trying to travel to. Travel should not just be expanded to neighboring planets; with the topic of space travel being more popular than ever, human can start the new era of space travel.",4
0d125d4,"The big debate is wether we should use automated cars that are operated without a use of a driver controling it. I believe that this may be the way to create driving easier and safer for everyone. Driverless cars are going to be a great thing if the big companies like Google and General Motors keep developing this concept of a car drving on its own.

The whole idea of having a car drive on its own just seems like a dream. Well in today's world we already have driverless cars in use in states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. I believe that this is a big long term plan. It isn't just going to change in a year or two, this process in going to take time to develop. In today's world there are car wrecks that happen every single day, but what if we could stop the amount of wrecks with automated cars that sense danger and bring down the percent of wrecks a day. If we would be able to do this, it would make it safer to be on the roads and the streets not having to worry about other cars crashing into you.

Now there are a lot of people that are highly against this idea. They believe that it will take to long. That we should trust our instincts while driving. Another thing is this process would have to be allowed by the law and government. I have to argue that this going to take a long time to covert everything for automated cars, and yes it will be expensive for the starting years. Think about it long term, everyday we use up natural rescources of our planet. Scienctists say that there are only so many natural resources and that we need to start conserving these resources. Cars fill up for gas everyday and use up these resources. Google's Cofounder Sergey Brin envisions that these automated cars will use half the fuel of regular cars today. That is a big difference and it will save us in the long run.These car can keep a safer environment for people. The human's can't rely on one another while driving. Too many people die every year in car crashes because someone was drinking too much or had some impairment while driving. Just think, the automated cars can't get drunk and swerve into another car.

When this discussion comes up later in life remember this. These cars can hold the key for more resources in the future, and make it safe to be on the roads again. Be on the side of this argument that can make a difference in today's world and society.",4
0d190c0,"The author gives good reasons on why we should explore Venus. He/she describes the environmental hazards of the planet in order to explain to us on how NASA can explore and research it more. The author gives reasons on why we should take the risk to explore Venus such as it being closest to Earth, has potential for an earth-like atmoshphere, and can be a good use of planetary visit in the future.

According to the article, Venus is the the closest planet to earth after Mars; but that is depending on where we are when orbiting around the solar system. ""Often referred to as Earth?s ?twin,? Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too""(Venus 2). This part of the article is what describes the fact that it is similar to Earth. The planet is our neighbor, which makes it easier so that we wouldn't have to use tons of time, energy, and money on something that is too many light years away.

The author gives info on how Venus may have some Earth-like features which would be good so that we can use it as a secondary planet if something goes horribly wrong with Earth somehow. Venus has been reported to have similar structures such as valleys, mountains, craters, and even potential ocean life. The planet even has weather and similar natural disasters like Earth such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and even lightning stikes. ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Venus 3). These are just some of the reasons the author gives on what potential Venus could have.

Finally, the author thinks that Venus would be a good backup planet to Earth, but it would be difficult to claim the land as ours and so that we could live there without any type of circumstances. The author also gives reasons on why it would be difficult to explore and find a way to live on this planet. But, it would give NASA a challenge on figuring out on what type of innovations they can make up. The author says on paragraph 5,""NASA?s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way""(Venus 5). These reasons alone can convince the reader that exploring and studying this planet would be worth the hard work and effort put into the inventions. The author could have given some reasons on why another planet to live would be worth THAT much work, but they did a good job otherwise.

The author has given good reasons and claims that made his or her's article convcing for the most part. They had evidence that can convince us and give us high hopes on what NASA could benifit from. The author wants us to explore Venus because it is closest to Earth, has potential for an earth-like atmoshphere, and can be a good use of planetary visit in the future. ",4
0d5a937,"Robot cars or driverless cars should not be developed. The development of thes cars can lead to many negative influences. Such as lacking or lazieness, wrecks, a lot of money and could be hacked. Driverless cars to many people is a thumbs down.

There are many different things that the humans just phiscally need to do and driving is one of them. The development of cars that can get you from point a to point b is already good enough. Most teenagers and adults like the thought of them being able to drive phsically and mentally. It would get boring after awhile because you would just be sittting there the whole entire time not incontrol of anything. There has been way to many technology objects that has been created which has been proven to make the human generation lazy. Creating safer transportation is positive and should be the direction cars should be leading towards. Driverless car may sound a little cool, but could lead to many dangerous harm.

The dangers of a car driving itself isn't so safe. There could be many malfuntions that could create car crashes. Many malfuntions could happen such as not braking in time, string uncontrolably, elctrical explosions, or maye even if the car accelerates when it's not needed. Teenagers could sitting in one on the road texting and not paying attention while the vechile is heading towards a tree or a person. The danger zones of driving will rise even more. Technology with other minor things is already expensive, hard telling how much these cars would cost.

Cars already are very expensive to buy now, so what could make these cars easy to produce and sell? People just need to learn how to drive and enjoy it. the safty of the driverless cars isn't asured to the public and can make tragities. With all the new technology what couldn't stop a hacker hacking into your cars computer base. And then you have automakes and driver problems in who would accident fault would be on. this driverless car inventing process should just be stopped.",4
0d92fb8,"Driverless cars sound amazing right ? In the 21st century you have many different people trying to create some type of new technology to make people's everyday lives to be much easier. How safe is the driverless car going to be ? Is the car going to help you stay safe at all times? People have gotten really close to making car to where it doesn't need a drive to drive it.

Driverless cars may sound cool but are they really useful? In the text it states that "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents""(7). The car can only do so much without a human having to come in and take over. The car has certain features that it can do all by itself but it is always going to need a human to do most of the task. I do not feel like the cars should be made to drive themselves. If an accident were to happen there would be no one to put the blame on because you have a car that can drive itself but then you have a driver in the driver seat. In the text it specifically states "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver or manufacturer?(9).Since there is no one to put the blame on the person is just going to be injured and is not going to know how they are going to make it if no one is responslibe for the accident.

In conclusion the driverless cars should not be made because they aren't really useful. In the text it says "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?""(8). If the car can't drive itself there is no point of the car being made. If its called a ""Driverless"" car then why does it need a driver when accidents are near or while they are driving through work zones? The cars would just honestly waste everyone's time because they are not what they say they are. In the text it also states "" This means the human driver must be alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs""(7). The car will never be able to drive with out a drive in the car to help get it out of certain situations like a traffic jam , accident or etc.   ",4
0da2967,"Have you ever thought of having a car that could drive itself? It would be a pretty cool car to have but there are some things you have to think about when you consider on buying a car. Of course the car is going to be expansive but what car isnt? There are alot more negative things you have to think about when buying a smart car. Negative aspects of a driveless are is that they are expensive, need many sensors, and they result in many accidents.

A driveless car is very expansive because they have to know the roads, when to stop, how to stop, or when to go. It stated "" These smart-road-systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Driveless cars work well but they are too expensive because they have to know the upgrades of roads. Imagine the cost you have to pay for the car, giving them their money back for the money they spent and work they spent putting into the car. Sensors are a very big issues too in driveless cars.

Driveless cars require many sensors in order for the car to work and drive on its own. It seems cool but what will happen when one of those sensors stopped working and you didnt know? The sensors were placed every where in the car so therefore it can work properly. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor..."" There is a lot of sensors installed inside the car but something can go very wrong if one of them stop working and the car crashes and injure somebody.

Who fault would it be if someone is injured because of techonlogy failure ? Driveless car are not reliable due to safety concerns. ""Manucatures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe... If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If someone is hurt because the technology of the car, you really can't say who to blame. Although the driver can take control of the car at any time so therfore the driver can be at fault because the driver wasn't paying attention to the road. The driveless car is supposed to make the driver aware of danger but it couldn't have if there was an accident so the car can be at fault to. No one really Knows who to blame because both the car and the driver took responsible of the accident and they both could have prevented the accident from happening. If the car would have alerted the driver, the driver could have took control BUT if the driver eas paying attention, he could have once again took control.

There are positive and negative aspects when it comes to driveless cars but of course no one pays attention to the negative. When thinking about purchasing a driveless car you have to think about the cost and your safety concerns. Driveless cars are very expensive because of the sensors that are installed and the upgrades to road. They are dangerous becuase due to technology failure they can result into car accidents. Expence, sensors, and accidents are negative aspect of driveless ares.",4
0da50b1,"Driverless cars would be an amazing new technology to introduce to the world. The ability to simply call a taxi and have a driverless car pick you up and take you wherever you wish, whenever you wish will revolutionize the way people get around. The technology may be in its primitive stages as of now, but soon driverless cars can help to automate many tasks that are currently being done by humans. Driverless cars will be an excellent addition to the modern world.

Not only does the driverless car make sense practically, it also has many safety benefits. If all cars on the road are driverless, they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents, unlike with human drivers who can only control the car so well. The automated cars will be directly linked to brake systems, so if there is a need to brake, the car is hydroplanning, or another emergency is occuring, the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out by applying specific amounts of brake to each tire, as explained in section 5 of the story. Another safety measure taken with driverless cars is the ability for a human to take over. Google's driverless car will notify its passengers if they need to take over the wheel, as explained in section 7 because the task on the road is too difficult for the car to perform. Assurance of the ability for a human to still control the car is very important, since even though the computer systems onboard the car may be very smart, humans have the ability to judge most situations better than any computer can.

One counterargument to driverless cars is the loss of jobs. This is not stated in the article, but it would be an issue with driverless cars regardless. Many people working as taxi drivers, trash truck drivers, freight truck drivers, or any job involving driving can lose their jobs. This is a problem, especially in the US where there is already a shortage of jobs. Although driverless cars will bring many benefits, the cons of them have to be talked about as well.

Driverless cars are a scary prospect. The thought of a car driving itself can make many people uneasy. If done correctly, however, driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work. With companies such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan planning to have fully automated and driverless cars on the road and ready to go by 2020, driverless cars are just that much closer to becoming a reality. Driverless cars would make an excellent addition to the modern world.",4
0dd72fb,"Is studying Venus worthy to pursuit the ande it will presents in the future? In the article of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states about why humans should study Venus. Students and humans should study Venus because they can anticipate will happen to the Earth, why no spaceshifts have been to Venus for more than three decades, and more importantly, how techonology can help us.

First,Venus is the second planet from the sun and it is not difficult to see from distance but it does takes up safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challengeing place ro examine more closely. Astronomoes are fascinated by Venus on how it may once have been the most Earth like plantet in our Solar Systems.

Next, for the past three decades of years, previous missons was unmaned and not a single spacecrafts survided the landing to Venus for more than a few hours. This explanins why not a single spaceshifts have touched down to Venus for quite a long time. The National Areonautics and Space Administrations want to send humans to study Venus so that the possible hostile conditon on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to flot above the fray.

Finally, Modern computers are enormouslt powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons. For example exposing a cell phone or a tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. Therefore systems that use mechanicals parts can be made of more resistants to pressure, heat, and other forces. Devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require eletronics.

In conclusion, if we humans study Venus, we would likely be preapred for what will happen next in the future but humans returning to Venus seem indisputable. Our travels on Earth should not be linited by dangers and dobuts but it should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. We should be able to help our Earth for dangers coming in.   ",4
0de71cb,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author effectively supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by arguing that it is the closest and most similar planet to Earth and highlighting the strides made by NASA that would keep humans safe on Venus. These two points are made in order to convince readers that the good outweighs the bad through logic and scientific discoveries.

The author begins with the argument that Venus is the most similar to Earth. This is a good argument to make because it lowers the ambiguity which may cause those opposed some heartburn. The text reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This provides insight into the physical makeup of Venus that needs to be explored while showing that it has similar features to Earth. They also mention that it is the closest planet to Earth which lowers the amount of space travel. This could be a safer option as it would lessen the amount of complications on the way there that are caused by long periods of time. Next, the author uses NASA to prove that exploration of Venus would be safer due to scientific discoveries and manuevers. According to the text, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" From there the author acknowledges the shortcoming of that idea due to distance and lists out innovative technologies that could get closer to the surface, the first being a mechanical computer. The mechanical computer does not rely on technology and is made of material that could combat the intense heat of Venus. This is an effective way of proving the claim because it provides one solution, acknowledges its faults, and provides another solution to remedy that. This does not leave room for an opposing arguement because the opposition work has already been done. Lastly, the author makes an effort to appeal to the emotion of the reader. The author states, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". They claim that if we never explore Venus due to doubt, then we can never explore other places that may give us some doubt as well. Essentially, they claim that fear should not stop exploration.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author makes the case for the exploartion of Venus despite the dangers by using a number of arguments that appeal to readers both logically and emotionally. The author effectively supports the idea by using evidence from trusted sources, like NASA, and putting them together to make a logical arguement that could appeal to readers.      ",4
0dff325,"Dear state senator,

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. I say this because, as successful as the Electoral College has been, it has many flaws. In the first sentence of the eleventh paragraph, the article mentions something called the disaster factor. This is an alarming possiblity. State legislatures are, in a way, responsible for choosing electors who may ignore the will of the people.

During 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, people titled Segregationists almost succeeded in removing the Democratic electors and replacing them with new electors. These new electors were supposed to oppose John F. Kennedy so that any popular votes for Kennedy would not have really gone to him. If those Segregationists had succeeded in their plan, John F. Kennedy would not have won the popular vote. That was indeed a close call, and it could happen yet again in the near future without fail. On another similar topic, ""faithless"" electors have, from time to time, denied the option to vote for their party's candidate. Instead of voting for the candidate of their own party, they cast a vote for whomever they wish.

Also occuring in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. Thankfully, he was presiding over the Senate at the time. He made sure to validate the slate of his choosing ""without establishing a precedent."", as stated in paragraph eleven, sentence 9. Hopefully, this will not occur again anytime soon.

The most worrying occurance would be a tie. However, if a tie were to happen in an electoral vote, the election would be thrown towards the House of Representatives. There, the state delegations vote on the president. In 1976, a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters from Hawaii had voted the other way. This is bad because the election is only a few voters away from a distaster. In conclusion, the Electoral College is not only unfair, but outdated and irrational. It should be shifted from the way it is now to total amount of popular votes for the president of the United States.    ",4
0e03564,"Are beeping horns accidents part of today's dreams for the future? Techology corporations such as Google and car companies dream of dangerous, driverless cars as a normal neccesity in the future transportation. However, there are many issues with the autonomous public transportation these companies dream of. The most important being; driverless cars are too dangerous for practical use.

While it is true that driverless cars may become a convenience, they may also be impractical for use in many dangrouse road conditions. The development of such cars show the have complications when, ""dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork and accidents"" (Unknown). With navigational issues like these, driverless cars should not be on public roadways.

Of course drivers could manouver these conditions manually, but if they are distracted maynot notice the alerts to take the wheel. In fact, distractions are another major issue with driverless cars. Driving laws require a full attention to the road. However, drivers may, ""get bored waiting on thier turn to drive"" (Unknown). If the driver is bored, then they may take their eyes off of the road or even drift off to sleep. When the time comes to take the wheel, they may not be prepared and accidents will happen.

The autonomous cars drempt by many corporations are not just dangerous for the owners of these machines, but other drivers as well. If an owner of a driverless car becomes distracted, other drivers will have to take action to avoid the misshaps of the automonous vehicle. More accidents could very well happen as a consecence of avoiding an accident. Attempting to avoid an accident may also cause not just one, but many as a result of a pile up.

The problems with these cars are very clear. While they may be fun toys for the rich, they should not be put on public streets. The dangers outweigh the convenience. These machines are just not safe enough for the public and should not be sold.",4
0e22bc3,"We have been fascinated on driverless cars since the late 1950s.There is both pros and cons when it comes to the aspects of driverless cars. Sergey the google cofunder envisions a futeer with a public transportation sysytem theat would use half the fuel of a taxi .The car would even have more flexability than a bus .driverless cars could fundamerntally change the world. But there are roadblocks that lies ahead for driverless cars

The companies that are making driverless cars for example, General Motors created a special test track that has electrical cables in them that send radio signals to the front end to the car. The road systems worked really well surprisingly but was to exspensive to build .So google modified the toyota prius with sensors on the wheel ,the roof , and a gps receiver.and a internal motion sensor the car had ther skill of a human driver behind the wheel.

Even though, the car could basically drives itself it could not handle such things like work zones and around accidents.the car simply notifys the driver to take over but how would the driver remain focoused on the raod? Why would annyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? . The aspects of

automation is really challenging because wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for there turn to drive?

Safety is aslo a very big concern such as keeping drivers,passengers and pedestrians safe. We know safety is best when the driver is alert and in control at all times so how would that happen if they arent driving most of the time?There are not even any liability laws yet so if the technology fails who would be acccountable the driver or the manufactuar? In some states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars . so is it as safe as we thought it woul be?

The devlopment of the driverless stretches ahead of us. we grow closer to finding the answers that we need to figure out if the autonomous is truly right for us .Even though,its some good points that need to be figured out about the driverless car.But it wouldnt be truly right until we get them all figured out.until then we get closer to that destination every day.",4
0e233ca,"In the years of 1976, a spacecraft snapped photographs for possible sites for the Viking 2 to land. In the photo that was taken, a fairly large head-looking object that was nearly 2 miles long was on the Red Planet. This caused many people to believe; What if there's life on Mars? It seems like a head but i strongly believe it is just a natural landform.

Scientists have proved that the theories of the object being a sign of life was highly unlikely. However when it comes to consipiracy theories, people are very stubborn to believe them without any proof. The scientists figured that it was simply a mesa which is pretty common around there except according to the text, ""-this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Later, the image was unveiled and it certainly caught a lot of attention!

Since it caught a lot of people's attention, it soon starred in a Hollywood film, was in books, magzines, and radio talk shows according to the text. This would obviously cause more people to believe it is a sign of life on Mars, since it went so viral. But the thing is is that it is not evidence of life, yet so many say it is. It has not been scientifically proven. NASA themsleves have said that it is just a natural landform. Also, movies, magazines, and books overexaggerate things so they really aren't evidence.

I believe it is a landform just like any other. Here on Earth, we have plenty of landforms. According to the text, scientists have said that landforms are very common around there, specifically Martian mesas. Coincidentally, this landform just so happened to be shaped like a head. There are plenty of landforms and other objects that look like other objects. Here on earth we could have a rock shaped like a heart or a pond shaped like a nose.

I also believe that it is just the people's imagination that leads them to believe this. Sometimes our imaginations and theories can't always be correct. There are plenty of conspiracy theories out there. I believe that if you do not have solid evidence for such theories, don't believe them.

On April 5, 1998, the object was proven to be a natural landform which proved some scientists wrong about their theories about it being an alien monument. It was proven by the Mars Global Surveyor which flew over Cydonia to check on the unusual object. This proves that there is no life on Mars and that the ""face"" is just a natural landform.

According to the text, it really is the Martian equivalent of a mesa or a butte which are common around the American West. So this concludes my argumentative essay on why I believe the Face is just a natural landform.                   ",4
016010c,"Driverless Cars

Driverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.

Driverless cars are really beneficial. Driverless cars have way more senors and alerts than regular cars. For example, if the car is about to back up into an object, the driver's seats will vibrate to let you know. Also, within the past 10 years, sensors on the driverless cars have become way more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Driverless cars are also very safe to use. The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word ""driverless"" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7)

Driverless cars are going to become the next big thing. They won't just become beneficial to you, but everyone else as well. The cars would only use half the fuel that today's taxi use. Which is a huge deal because we as a whole, we use a lot of fuel. Also, it will offer more flexibility than a bus. Just imagine that. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes these such cars would fundamentally change the world, and everyone else should believe that too. (Paragraph 1)

Some people may agrue that letting a car be in control is just absurb. You never know what the car might do. It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe.

In conclusion, driverless cars are very safe and have major benefits. Some people may be scared of letting a car be in a control, instead of them being in control of the car. But no one should have nothing to worry about. As long as you stay alert, you should be fine. Even though the car can do many things by itself, it still sends you heads up when it needs your assistance. Driverless cars coming very soon in the near future. Try them and see how they are.",5
01c5e87,"No, i do not agree with America creating ""driverless"" cars . Depending on a machine to navigate the roads and sucessfully take you to your destination is an accident waiting to happen litterally. Who would be at fault if a wreck were to accure? Would you really be able to have piece of mind while letting your car do the driving?

First, you have to think about who would really be at fault if an accident happened. In the article it states that ""if technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" Well it would be challenging to understand that fully, because if something were to happen with one or more sensors malfunctioning, than how can you blame the driver in that case? The maufaturing companies would have to run numerous tests and double check to insure that all of the sensors and gadgets on the vehicle are in working order and stay that way so they deliver a safe product on their part. At the time of the wreck, you will have to take into concideration what each driver was doing, and the steps leading up to the event to come to a conclution of who fault it is.

Secondly, the cars arent 100% driverless, you still have to take over the wheel when need be. When in these cars, the driver has to give his/her full attention at all times, so you might as well be in an ordinary vehicle. A quote from the text states ""their cars have driven more than a million miles without a crash but sofar, Google's cars arent trully driverless; they alert the drivers to take over the when pulling in and out of drive ways or dealing with complicated issues, such as navagating through road work or accidents."" Having to take over when their is a contruction zone or driveways etc, is not the deffinition of a full driverless car to me.

lastly, the cars have fancy sensors and other tools and whatnot , but these cars still call for human skills. Driverless cars are intelligent but may not be able manage a situation if you were to look down at your phone quickly or something else along the lines of that. The information states that ""they can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. You have to stay focused on the road and guide the car if needed in a situation. if you want to not stay locked on the road and do another thing while in the car, these vehicles are not for you.

In conclusion, i do not approve of these inventions until it is proved that they are 100% safe and until you dont have to pay attention to driving the whole time. Driverless cars still need the skill of a human behind the wheel, they arent fully driverless and something may not work in proper order, and also you have to think about who would be at fault if a wreck happened. These are all things we need to take into concideration before going out and purchasing one of these new vehicles.

01dabde,"Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down and how is it benificial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day hope to buy and all the modifications they will make to 'trick it out'. Many people though end up being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it then that. So what advantages could there be to a? world with fewer cars on the road?

The first topic that is at the forfront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, thats just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don't really need. Now I know what your thinking but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting anymore right? With public transportation becomingh more and more avalible many people are choosing to take the public bus rather then buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you pay. What you thought they went to police and teacher's wages and building nice little parks for the kiddies? Well acording the Environmantal Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted citys are even begining to put laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and placing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and matnence as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways theres a lot of dough pouring into your car drives.

Now heres the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but its still very important, the environment. Car emmisions are the second biggest source of polllution in the atmosphere, first place going to powerplants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? Its not the the planets health we're talking about here its the health of everything living on it including us. While we're on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier then ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emmisions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outside playing football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldnt if there were less cars on the road. So think of the health of your familly, your friends, your pets, and yourself.

Finally we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to carpool take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticibly prominent that car companys are trying to come up with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Citys are coming up with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and imporve safty"". So for those of you that can't stand to be left behind by the times jump on the band wagon and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.

Cars, the parasprites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emmisions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a milenia poisoning the air we breath and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to stop it now this travesty will continue to ravange all life on the planet untill we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and help to push this new trend of a car free world.

01f5682,"Dear State Senate,

I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,? the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters? would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Paragrapgh twenty-three, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.       ?       ??????????    ",5
022a010,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be slightly helpful, but other than that, not at all. While few would benefit from being taught by a computer, others, not so much.

Dr. Huang said that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe this is wrong, as there is no way of making a student less bored. If you were to add entertainment to the mix of the lesson, then how could the lesson be taken seriously? Teachers tend to add their own spice to lessons that, both, make the students laugh, and become more interested in the lesson. No computer could mimick a human's humor. A computer also would not be able to explain things as well as a teacher could. A computer could modify the lesson as many times as it could, but the student would still be confused. A teacher would be able to explain things better and make it simpler than a computer could. It would also be quicker.

It is proven that students learn better with paper and a physical learning environment. Sure, a computer would know more and be able to explain things more properly, but knowing this fact... Would it even be worth teaching the student if they won't even remember it? Technology would also completely replace the need to write down notes by hand. With a physical environment, you also learn life skills. For example, knowing when to speak and ask questions, manners, and getting along and working with others. These skills are often used in work environments.

And, what about those who have no access to technology? Poverty and homelessness are still big in the world. Sure, your child could participate in a physical environment at a school, but why would there be a need for schools if it is all on the computer? It would also be cheaper for school officials to have computers than to have teachers that require a weekly or monthly pay, and to not require supplies for the children as well. It would quickly spiral into a ""be rich or be homeless"" world in an instant. A lot of stress would be put on the backs of many people who wish for their child to get an education. We already give these people a hard time, why given them an even harder time, and even include their children?

In conclusion, a lot would be wrong with using the Facial Action Coding System in schools. Very few would benefit from having such advanced technology instead of teachers and a physical environment, but the rest would be disadvantaged.",5
02ab5d2,"One car, one life, one big accident. That is all the future is asking to develope by continuing to try to improve and inspire people to use ""driverless cars"". I do not think driverless cars should ever become a new big thing for many reasons. They can malfunction on you. They still need assestence if they cant handle a road situation. They might not update any new laws or road changes nearby. There is so many negative reasons and thoughts that appear when thinking about the development of driverless cars.

My first reason to why I am against driverless cars is because they can always malfunction. What if it doesnt see an animal in the road and runs it over will it stop to help, would it starting loosing control? Who knows because your not the one behind the wheel. You could have stopped and saved that poor animal, instead you let your car take control. Also what if it just shuts down? Turns off completely in the middle of the road. All electronics have a point in time where they are slow and slowly begin to shut down. How long would you have the car to keep? Do you think a driverless car can last you up to 10 years? Maybe if your lucky. The weather and the technology cant keep up and hold its together as long as a gas opperated automobile is. What if it doesnt let you take control because it malfunctions and you end up hurting someone? Like it says in the text ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?

Also, what even is the point to have an automotive that still needs you in the car. If its not smart enough to drive without needing your assistence it would be useless. So say you are driving down the street and your texting and letting you car drive on its own. All of a sudden it crashes and hurts other including yourself. It would still be your fault even though you was not the one driving. In other words if you get in a car accident would the police put your car in jail or you? Well you offcorse if your even recovered from the crash your car has put you in anyways. Driverless cars allows drivers to think they can keep their eyes off the road when all reality they have to pay attention and be alert. If you have to have your eyes remained on the roads at all times then you might as well drive, atleast you will be secure and more alert.

Finally the car over all is just a big mimic. People are tying to develope objects with human like qualities. In the text it even says ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Personally I believe being human is special and an automobile can never be as special as a human life. Yes we may love our cars but never as much as one would love there children, friends, or family.

Driverless cars are just an overall bad idea and we should keep our state safe and the people in it. I'm not the only one who agrees. Driverless cars are illegal in most states. In the text it mentions ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" This shows that im not the only one who belives they are not safe and no matter what upgrades and assumptions that are made will not make a driverless car a good idea. Lets be original and stick to the safe way lets avoid the one car, one life, one accident.              ",5
02f6c8a,"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution. ",5
0459116,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able? to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ? ?    ",5
04b354e,"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" (Office Of Federal Register 6), the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair. The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.

The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare"";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.

Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. The? tie-breaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" (Plumer 12). This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.

Entering the booth next election day, dont only think about who you are voting for, but also how you are voting for them. It makes all the difference, and, ultimately, the popular way is the best way.    ",5
05592d5,"People over the years that have been talking about cars that drive themselves have found this topic very interesting because of the phrase"" Cars that drive themselves"". Yes it sounds interesting and very cool and far into the future but there are downsides to this idea and there are some good sides. It depends on the people that you ask because some could say oh no way! Then there are some that could say oh yes way! Then you have to think of it this way, are these futuristic cars even safe for humans to be in?

Driverless cars do sound really cool to me because then you don't really need to do anything but sit back and watch. Then again I just don't think that I would want a car that drives itself only because of the dangers it kind of puts you in. For example, in the passage it states that these cars have all of these sensors on it that can keep you safe while you're driving it, well what do you do if while that car is driving and one of the sensors malfunctions and there is a car running a stop sign while it's your turn to go what do you do? You won't even see the car coming from the side of you and that sensor malfunctioned so it can't alert the car then you get smacked into by the other vehicle. These cars do come with very dangerous factors and possibilities that can happen at any given moment. So yes these cars are cool but I would never get one for myself.

In paragraph two when it talks about how television and movies have been fascinated with cars that drive themselves, I think it can be a bad thing for them doing that. That's because the way movies and TV portray the driverless cars is so unreal but others who don't understand that well, they could be in a good amount of danger. For example in the movie Transformers, every single one of those cars drive themselves. They steer themselves, they can open their own doors, they can do all of this stuff and someone who actually believes that that is what these manufacturers are coming out with, then they are wrong because they think that it will be able to do that stuff and while they're distracted BOOM! They just got t- boned by another driver because the person wasn't paying attention. These cars could really cause a lot of danger to society.

Driverless cars are way too dangerous to me, I feel like people would be irrisponsible with them and cause harm to the community. I'm against cars that drive themselves for right now until they can proove to me that these cars are 100% safe. Like we all know today there are crazy drivers out thtere and with them on the road with a car like this, that could put a ton of people in danger. To help prove my whole point in paragraph 9 it says that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer""? Well here is the thing, it said if the technology fails. That means that there is a chance of the technology failing and causing harm, just like a lot of other technology can do. For example, some sort of saw to cut wood or metal. If one of those things malfunctions and a blade goes flying it could hit someone and easily kill them. Not all technology is 100% fool proof so that is why I wouldn't trust this driverless car.

So once again I do not support the creation of one of these driverless vehicles because of a safety issue. Even if this car does have all of these sensors on it that doesn't mean that it is totally safe because you still have all of these other crazy drivers on the road that could potentially smack into if they aren't paying attention or even if you aren't paying attention. Yes in the movies these cars do look really cool but I don't think that they need to be created and brought into real life. I say that we just stick to what we already do. That's having actual people drive the car instead of having a computer programmed into the car driving it. Now I know people don't drive 100% either but what if the technology fails and someone dies in a crash? Then what do you do? You definitely can't blame the person for something that a company made malfunctioning. We the people just need to stop and think about what all could happen if you let a computer drive your two to three ton vehicle.                          ",5
0668f09,"The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coinsided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.

To begin with, banning cars/reducing them will benefit our ecosystems and enviornments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog; it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing (Source 2). That CO2 rises into the air, the atmopshere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of car-pooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3; and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael Sivak brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, ""Mine (19 and 21) [speaking of her children] have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Alongside with the bettering the enviornment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the city/town. In Bogota, Columbia (according to Source 3) new paths have been opening up, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city,"" stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks; DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.

In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the enviornment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and check-up like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",5
0670d67,"Driving into the Future

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheal vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that proccess situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and elliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can proccess situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival itme. Smart cars, as the leading industrys call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintaing eyes on the road. These cars are maintaing a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safley navigate out of it and overide the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, drving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel. I would certainley choose the computer driving me, my friends and coworkers around for my safety and theirs.",5
0687af4,"Driverless cars will bring great benefits to the human race. They can provide a level of safety that many people are unable to provide, and they can allow for new freedoms and options for those on the road. They can take people to the hospital if someone is injured, and they can also bring a person to his/her home, if needed. The possibility of driverless cars is slowly becoming a reality, thanks to the work done by various companies. Google has already created a modified car capable of maky of these things, and other auto makers have followed in Google's footsteps. Automated cars will be helpful in the future due to the safety brought by the introduction of promising technology, and the steady progress in the fields of robotics and cars.

The technology used in driverless cars is very advanced, able to process information and respond in the time comparable to a human. They can respond generally better to dangerous situations than that of the human mind as well. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash""(2). These cars are trustworthy in a safety sense, and they know when it is neccessary to give control back to the driver.""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead repuires human skills""(7). This means that not all control is relinquished to the car. Truthfully, most of these driverless cars actually build from a driver assistance system, where the car helps the person drive rather that drive for the person. Automated cars can soon be possible for all of humanity.

Humanity has already come a long way from the past, when people would dream of robotic cars. Car companies have developed technologies that can make those dreams a reality. ""'There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.'"" Nowadays, cars are now able to have their own radar systems. Google modified a car to have a motion sensor, GPS, and four radar sensors. In the future, many automotive companies plan to have their own driverless cars. Tesla plans to have a car by 2016. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan will push to have automated cars by 2020. Progress is already happening in the car industry.

Driverless cars are a possibility for humanity. In the past, people would dream of being able to sit in a automated car. Today, the world's first robotic cars are being produced. There are those who oppose the idea of having a robot drive, but there are results that speak for the effectiveness of driverless cars. In the future, there will be many more automated cars, and there will also be many less deaths and injuries on the roads.",5
0689c67,"The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.

There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.

If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.

They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.

While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.                 ",5
06c3953,"""Face"" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the ""truth"" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it says ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.

08519b2,"Since Henry Ford made the first Model T, people have been obsessed with the idea of transportation.? This idea has evolved into many things between then and now.? We now have entire sports dedicated to cars and motorcycles, cars powered by alternate energy sources, and many other novel concepts that have taken the world by storm.? However, there are many potential advantages of limiting your use of our precious automobiles.

One of the first reasons that you should reduce your usage of cars is found all around us, in the environment.? Some statistics of the current amount of damage we cause by using our cars like we do include that fact that passenger cars are responsibel for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some areas of the United States.? Imagine if we could reduce those numbers?? David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America (a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United states), said ""How much you drive is as important as whether you drive a hybrid.""? There are some places that are taking this concept to heart.? One example of this is in Bogota, Columbia, where on certain days every year, a Day Without Cars in the captial city leaves only buses and taxis with permission to be on the roads.? Despite the rain on the third time the event took place, the turnout was still great.? There were even other cities, Cali and Valledupar, that took part in the fun.? Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic about what they saw.? The country of Colombia has made a concious effort to reduce their carbon footprint since the mid-1990s.? Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicicyle paths as well as parks and sports centers have also cropped up.? This also in turn resulted in an improved economy as new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up. The current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has also recently unveiled ambitious goals to curb the US's greenhouse gas emmisions.? Wouldn't it be great if we could all help the environment out by reducing our usage of cars?

How great would it be, if at the same time as leanding the earth a helping hand, you were able to improve your own happiness?? In Vauban, Germany and several other places globally, this has already begun to take effect.? The people of this city are part of the ""Smart Planning"" movement.? This experimental community on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders, is taking reducing autombile usage to a whole new level.? Seventy percent of Vauban's families simply do not own a car.? Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two living in Vauban, said ""When I had a car, I was always tense.? I'm much happier this way,"" as she walked the verdant streetes where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering people drown out an occasional distant motor.? The ""Smart Planning"" movement isn't just restricted to this place though.? It is merely an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use.? In Bogota, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" on a Day Without Cars.? Some may still say though, ""How if by giving up my car, will I be happier?? I will have to find some other transportation mean and potentially have to wake up much earlier than I already to get everywhere.? That seems more stressful to me.""? However, due to the recession in the US, many people are having to do adapt this type of lifestyle out of necessity.? Many can't afford new vechiles but still must get to work somehow.? Even after the recession ends, many sociologists believe that many will not return their previous way of life.

Finally, there are already many plans in place to reduce automobile usage.? At the

Mobile World Congress in 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan that shows how impractical or undesireable it will be for many to own a vehicle.? He also proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create ciries in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.""? The Environment Protection Agency as well as legislators are promoting the reduced use of personal vehicles by working to induct a new six-year federal transportation bill, rather than previous ones that have devoted about eighty percent of the appropriations have gone to highway improvements and the remaining twenty percent to other transport.

To wrap everything up, there are many reasons that everyone should try to reduce automobile use.? For one, it will help the environment, it will increase general happiness, and finally, that there are plans that are already in place to make it more feasable for people to adopt this new lifestyle.? Whether we will see a drastic change or not, we will not know until we try.? But that all starts, with you.       ?    ",5
08cdf6e,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood. Being able to see and recognize more emotions for peers. Lastly it can help the user better ""communicate"" with the computer. ",5
08f5a36,"Driverless cars, although dangerous in a multitude of ways, have uses that far excede any dangers. It is said that in order to progress in life you must first take steps back. Although these driverless cars are a step forward in technology, they can be seen as a being a step backward because of the dangers that persist. In reality, these dangers are just a learning curve to arguably one of the most revolutionary inventions in the last decade, driverless cars. These cars are very fesable because they are sought after, the technology is available, and they are getting safer with time.

These driveress cars are some of the most sought after technology that has entered this world. The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,"" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality.

Not only are they sought after by millions, but the technology for these driverless cars is available and has been available. Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars.

The one thing that people can control about these cars is their safety. This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive.

The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out. Driverless cars are no longer a thing of the future but make up our present in every way imaginable.",5
08fbb47,"Is it possible to be too passionte about something? This author wrote an entire article on how challenging but worth it, it would be to visit Venus' crtiical atmosphere. How well does the author describe, or explain, their own opinion? They support this idea very thoroughly by these three things: The idea that life could have lived there before, the conditions are inhumane, and the fact that it could gain insight and can settle our curiosity.

To start, the idea that at one point in time there has acutally been life living on that planet is crazy. In paragraph four, it talks about how at on point there may have been big oceans like that are similar to the ones on earth. We think this because there are many rocky surfaces, such as valleys, mountains, and craters, that can only be formed from water eriodication. When you even look at it, it just look earth like. Obviously it has changed over the years but you can't rule it out. Is it possible there were living things on this planet at once?

Secondly, now the conditions are inhumane. How did they get that way? Paragprah three is all about what it is like on Venus. The temperatures now rise over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The air is absolutely unbreathable as it is made up of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Not only is there carbon dioxide floating around in the air, the atmosphere is mostly made up of sulfuric acid which is very toxic to be breathing in that much. The air pressure on Venus is ninety times deeper, or stronger, than the bottom of sea level. If we even tried ot land on Venus none of the metals would last in eight-hindred degrees. There are also many impediments such as erupting volacnos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting. Minus all these problems we would have to find a way around, the author believes that it is still worth it to visit Venus.

Lastly, we would gain so much insight and our curioustiy could be settled. Paragraph eight talks all about this and about how this could open the doors for us to learn new ideas and come up with new technology that could even help up here on Earth. They also state in paragraph eight to support the idea that despite Venus' risky conditions it would still make a worthy pursuit by saying, and I qoute, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Which I interpret as do not let these conditions scare us. We are so smart and we can be creative and find a way around all of these 'problems'.

In conclusion, how opinionated and factual can someone be? How do you know to balance these two things? At times we have to be one-hundred percent curious about what we are writing about because you don't want to write an article on something you don't care about or find important. Overall, how detailed and opionated was the author? In the end, I think that the author did a great job at explaining why they think it would be a worthy pursuit. Do you?",5
0906ee2,"Your feeling ten percent annoyed, fifty percent boared, and thirty percent suprised. Advancements in technology has been brought to an entire new era with facial readers. One computer can tell people how they feel about themselves just by the muscel structure and movements in their face. Who would not want to know what some stranger walking down the street is feeling? I mean, I know I would. Today our generation is amoung the nosiest. Classrooms today need these computers to better understand their class. Emotional expressions can change society by understanding children, making lives easier, and progressing technology.

Children have mood changes as fast as people chose fast food over vegtables. Children are a hard age to understand what they are feeling, becuase they are so quick at changing the things they are doing and always moving. Having a brain wired to becoming board with something one day and then wanting to do it again the nest day. That is hard for teachers to keep up with. Dr. Huang commented, ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or board."" But, with having a computer that classifies the six basic emotions and picks up each one takes a great stress off of teachers. Teachers have a class from anywhere to ten to fourty students. Having to know each one personally and be able to read what they are thinking to help further their education is a big task for underpaid teachers to do. Those fourty students have all different facial structures and the Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track their movements and weight the different units. Teachers understanding their students better with the Coding System, will help them further their education in a classroom when seeing if they are frustrated or upset.

Fourty students, fourty diiferent views, and fourty different emotions. That is a lot to take in. Having the Coding System in your classroom takes the relief off the teachers of figuring out each student. With the easy three step process anyone can read their emotions, but just by video it makes it three steps easier. With no wires and personal information to plug in. Teachers have students that do not like to share their feelings, which takes a lot of time for the teacher to understand what they are feeling taking away from other students. Dr. Huang stated, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Saving the time of teachers and peronalizing lessons for the class creates so many benefits. Not having this machine will not do damage in hurting the students, it is helping them.

Fifty years ago classrooms did not even have a smart board or computer labs, they had chalk boards. It is a fact some people do not like change. Parents probably did not like their children learning how to use computers or new technology. But our world is advacing, and makes it that much amazing to see how simply technology is helping change classrooms for the better. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are developing ways for us and computers to communicate. People think that is scary and weird. The fact is, we can learn about the artwork from hundreds of years ago with the sytem. Classrooms can have precise and exact answers with the system. Huang used Mona Lisa and they figured out that she was 83 percent happy, and 9 percent disguested. Can your art teacher tell you that?

Technology is helping further our classrooms education and learn abilites.

Classrooms benefit from the Facial Coding System. Many people will be against this new change, but they have no arguement. The Facial Action Coding System is easy, helpful, and dependable. As a teacher I would feel more comfortable with giving a lesson and teaching views ,they all understood and agreed with. Lives can change by understanding childrens minds, creating hard ache free lives, and keeping up with the new technology. ",5
098d10a,"The planet Venus may be one of our most valuable assets to understand our planet, but Venus has some dangers we cannot ignore. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job of suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by explaining the value of exploring Venus, the dangers, and how the dangers may be overcome.

Venus is very similar to Earth, sharing approximate densities and sizes. The planet also shares geographical features with Earth, such as rocky sediment, craters, and mountains. It is possible that hundreds of years ago Venus really might have been the twin planet to Earth. Astronomers have reason to beleive that Venus was home to oceans and various life forms. If we learn more about this planet, we could find the key to unlock the knowledge of how our home planet works. This supports the author's claim that we must study Venus further by providing reasons knowledge of Venus would directly affect everyday life on Earth.

The author also uses the possible dangers of exploring Venus to explain why we must pursue Venus, through all the challenges. Venus has a heavy atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide, making it impossible for humans to breathe freely on the planet. The pressure on Venus is so great that a person would be crushed, not to mention the extreme temperatures over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit. It would be impossible for an astronaut to explore on the planet's surface without proper technology. Adding to the already intense conditions, Venus has volcanoes, eartquakes, and frequent lightning, which present their own problems. The dangers help prove the author's point that even though dangerous, we must explore Venus.

The author describes possible solutions created by NASA to show that it will be possible to explore Venus, even with the dangers. NASA has proposed an idea of humans studying Venus from a vehicle hovering the planet, but this would not be optimal because the exploration would be very limited. Viewing Venus from thirty feet above would be better than no exploration at all and would create livable conditions, so it is a relatively safe option for gathering knowledge on the planet. Another idea is using mechanical computers on Venus. The computers can make calculations, without electronics. These computers are also more likely to withstand the extreme conditions of Venus, unlike modern computers. No plan can be one hundred percent safe, especially in a danger zone like Venus, but the benefits outweigh the risks. The author does a proficient job of portraying this in the article.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author presents the idea that Venus should be studyed intently, despite the risks. The author does a good job of explaining this by telling how we could benefit from knowledge of Venus, telling the dangers, and solutions to overcome the dangers of Venus. ",5
09c0506,"Dear Rick Scott,

Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state (Florida, Texas, etc.) to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College canidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are apposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican canidate. Many people say that the electoral college ""takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn't matter"" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the memebers of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?

Not only do the Citizen's votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state's vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids run-off elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state's vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a run-off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats; that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reudces, ultimatley showing a clear winner.

And finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State's Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It's also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimatley the most dangerous voter there is; an uner educated one.

So Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen's vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state's smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.        ?    ",5
0a50c61,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job to prove that Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers that are presented, they do this by giving information based on actual conditions, studies and actual experiences. The author used a combination of all three of these to prove their claim that Venus is worth the danger.

The conditions in Venus are a great mix of specific material. The author thoroughly explains each part of the atmosphere in Venus. The text says that "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify metals."" They are proving that the conditions on Venus would exceed anything that our bodies could handle.

Despite saying this, they make a point when they begin into the discussion of the education it could bring us. In the text it is shown that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet it our solar system."" The author supports his argument very well when they say this. They used a status stand point which gives the author more credibility. He then forms a question within the text, by doing this it brought them the opportunity to show the research they had conducted for this writing piece.

The author brought in the research on the true experiments that were thought up through NASA. He builds up NASA's ideas by explaining to the deepest points, but never hits an oppostion until the next paragraph. When they do this it creates an amazing idea that could have the possibility to work imaged into the readers heads.

They eventually hit the oppostition and shows the down fall with NASA's great plan. They state in the text that "" More importatnly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persoanl despite the risks."" When the author decides to say this they prove the irony of it all. If you can't be up close and personal with the planet then you can't learn the reasons you truly cannot be. From the opposing standpoint it was supported very well once they did that.

They then go back on track to support their claim. They do this by explaining the experiments done in the past. They state a comparison to the readers when they say, "" Just imagine exposing a cell phone tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin,"" This comment that was made impacts the writing positvely. When they do this it gives the readers something to think about or imagine. It brings the issue to them and gives them a chance to relate somehow.

The conclusion that he provides gives a clear closing. He states his claim again and uses his evidence to bring the topic to a point. The closing gives you something to think about, it leaves you wondering about the topic and forming your own opinions. In the conclusion it states, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet te very edges of imagination and innovation."" The right thing is to not starve us from the education that could be provided just because of a dangerous boundary. All of the evidence that they have stated and proven through the whole essay just ends with them eventually just stating that it is the right thing to do.

The author does a good job of proving this through the whole essay.              ",5
0aaae26,"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed.? Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote.? The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated.? Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers.? This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today?? This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives.? According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""? This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people.? If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election.? Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3.? ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.""? This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people.? Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system.? This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States.? According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""? If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote?? It only makes sense.? Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" (Source 3.)? But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements.? If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election?? Will it always produce a clear winner?? What about the event of a tie?? Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary.? The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.    ",5
0b5c44b,"Alien comics are the real deal?

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement.

0b9d88d,"Driverless cars are cars with an automated driving system. Cool right? Using binary code, sensors and even 3-D imaging to check surroundings. Sounds futuristic like something from Back to The Future or Star Trek. But what good could they really do in society. Driverless cars are coming but should they? Society today can do better without technology controlling even more of our lives and something so vital as cars.

Google has gotten a head start on this process of driverless cars. The article states the car can ""read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code."" Yes the car is smarter than the average human being, that's because it's a computer. A computer cannot make judgement calls like a human being. With the intent on not crashing a driverless car could make mistakes and not know that they are mistakes. Such as hitting a child in order to avoid crashing into a tree. Something this article did not touch on was that the Google self driving car had its first accident last week when it hit the side of a bus in Northern California.

Today we have sensors and cameras in our cars but the driver maintains the speed, directions and trajectory of the car and where it goes. Humans must remain alert at all times, as stated in this article. Even though with self driving cars there is no human error involved consequences could emerge from there being to many of these types of automobiles on the road at once.

If this car goes into mass production problems will emerge just like with every other car brand. We have today many tools to assist our cars in knowing when to stop, turn and check coolant and power steering levels. We are still in control. In the article isn't was stated that if a problem should arise ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" What if this function doesn't work? Should the driver always have to hands on the wheel or would that ruin the point of this driverless car.

Is society ready for this or is this years in the making and we are just getting ahead of ourselves. Either way self driving cars should not be allowed on the street without a driver until the technology is 100% proven error free. This could take some time but it's worth it. This will significantly limit the cost of lives that could come from unnecessary laziness caused by this driverless car. Human error will always be a problem but human judgment will by far outweigh the intelligence of automated systems. ",5
0c0463c,"Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents. The author certainly proves their idea on why they think studying the planet Venus is worth it. The author supports their idea by making sure to back it up with evidence. In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports their idea well by explaining Venus's relationship with Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the power human curiosity can have. The author's use of evidence shows readers how seriously they took what they were writing. All the points they made were backed up by evidence on why they felt that way. The author made sure to clearly support each and every point made in their writing.

First, the author uses Venus's relationship to our own planet, Earth, to support their ideas. For instance, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (4). The excerpt above illistrates some of the similar features Venus has to Earth. The author uses the similarities of the planets to support their idea of venus being a worthy pursuit. The text also states, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (4). The author uses this sentence to support their idea by explaining how Venus is one of the nearest options to Earth for space travel. Saving travel time is one way Venus shows it is a worthy pursuit. Overall, the author uses the relationship the planets Earth and Venus have with eachother to support their thoughts.

Secondly, the author uses the point of human curiosity to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. To illistrate, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.

Additionally, the author uses evidence about how landing on Venus is possible to support their idea that it is a worthy pursuit. For example, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). The author uses this piece of evidence to demonstrate that Venus's conditions are possible for humans to survive, making Venus a serious contendor for space exploration. The author also states, ""Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible.

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" demonstrates how despite the dangers Venus presents, it is worthy of pursuing. Exploring venus seems like it is almost impossible with all the risks it offers, but the author makes it clear in this article that they disagree. Their use of evidence in their writing to support their belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how well researched their case is. The author used evidence on Venus's relationship to Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the natural curiosity humans have to support their idea. After taking a look at this article, readers know that the points made in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" were very nicely supported. The author's support made their idea a thought provoking case.",5
0c442a8,"Venus is often known as the more dangerous 'twin' of Earth. It is located two planets away from the Sun but is hotter than Mercury, the planet next to the sun, even with it being further away. Although Venus is similar to Earth in size and a few other things, thick sheets of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid coat the earth, making it very difficult to research. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author presents reasons why Venus should be researched, despite the precautions scientists would have to take.

Visiting Venus does not indicate a need to be on the planet's surface. When thinking about being on and researching a planet, individuals would think about what it would be like to be visiting ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (3). A solution made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration claims they could possibly send scientists to Venus but instead of landing, they would ""float above the fray [of Venus]"" (5). This would allow scientists to do some more research on the difficult planet and keeping them safer by only introducing them to ""170 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""air pressure [that] would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). NASA is already introducing ideas that are very noteworthy and realistic for more exploration on the planet Venus.

Researchers are building machines and working innovatively to allow more time in Venus for further research. Years ago, rovers and spacecrafts were sent to Venus but ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (2). This information helps conclude how dangerous the planet is and how cautious scientists, researchers, and astronauts would have to be to visit or study more on. In recent years, NASA has worked more on building an electronic device completed with silicon carbide that ""lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" when ""tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface"" (7). This brings another level of excitement for the future of planet exploration because it extends the 'life expectancy' of the spacecraft. Some researchers have also been working on an old mechanical computer technology used in the 1800-1990s. They believe this may be effective on Venus because ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7) rather than more modern technology, which tends to be more fragile. The future of machines that could orbit Venus is worth pursuing for information and it may be a game-changer for all occupations wanting to learn more about the planet itself.

Although there are many valuable reasons as to why Venus is worth studying for, the author includes some evidence that indicate why Venus exploration is not succeeding as well. It is evident that the planet is clearly not accustomed for human settlement. The author reveals to the audience that ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3). This explains why a person has not visited and how deathly it would be if someone did. While the author explains how humans can explore even just above the clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, there is also evidence that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (6). Despite these facts given, the article ends with ""our travels onEarth and beyond should not be limited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8) and this contributes to why visiting Venus is worth it, making all the reasons against visiting less effective because they are not explained as thoroughly throughout.

Even with all the evidence and reasoning behind why the earth is too dangerous to study, the author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit as it is a challenge for the future of space exploration. Scientists and researchers have all the information they need to figure out a plan so they can pursue active studying on the planet Venus. With all precautions aside, Venus is worth spending time on if they can figure out how to do it effectively without too many troubles and hassles. ",5
0cae471,"The auhtor begins with information about Earth's twin, known as Venus, has been a scientific question for decades. One of the brightest points of light in the sky and somewhat the closest planet to earth looks and proximity wise, is in fact Venus. Venus may be very easy to see from a long distance, but the closer you get the more danger you are in. There are manyreasons on why scientists and astronomers keep going back to venus and attempting after many fails.

Considering that Venus is sometimes, depending on the speed in which Venus orbits the sun, the closest planet there are hardships on why humans cant land a spacecraft on it. Sending a spacecraft to Venus has been done numerous times, but not one survived more than just a few hours. This issue has caused Nasa to be discouraged and havent sent a spacecraft in over three decades. "" each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours""( paragraph.2) This is just one reason on why Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study.

The author states that Venus' atmosphere holds clouds made of sulfuric acid which is highly corrosive, melting most metals into liquid. On the surface, tempatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit as an average. Venus has the hottest surface tempature in our whole solar system. The air pressure is 90 times in what we experience on our own planet. These condiotions are far more worse than what an average person encounters on Earth, let alone a professional astronaut. Venus' environment alone could combust a submarine made to withstand the deepest parts of our oceans. The author also says that Venusian weather and geology have presented additional information such as erupting volcanoes, frequent lightening strikes, and powerful earthquakes. So why does the author think that studying Venus is worth these dangers?

The author found that scientists are discussing further visits to Venus becasue once a long time ago Venus might have been home to various forms of life. The planet holds a surface of rocky terrain and similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Given the long time frames of space travel, Venus is the nearest option, yet still isnt safe enough. "" the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" ( paragraph 2). NASA brought forth a very compelling idea for sending humans to Venus in order to study the planet. NASA's solution is for humans to hover above Venus' harsh ground conditions at 30 or so miles above the landscape. Temperatures will still be at a whopping 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and air pressure similar to sea level on Earth. Not easy but survivable for humans, this is the best idea NASA could provide. Although seeing Venus from a blimp like ship hovering safely above the planet would provide only limited insight on ground conditions, because some forms of light cannot penetrate Venus' dense atmosphere. As well as sight, astronauts cannot take samples from 30 plus miles in the air of the gas, rocks, or soil.

Despite these hardships, NASA is formulating other approaches to studying Venus. The author provided examples on their ideas such as simple electronics made of silicone carbide have been put in a chamber simulating the chaotic nature of Venus, and survived at least three weeks in these conditions. In conclustion the author supported this idea very well, and had a lot of information about the hardships and ideas formulating our jpurney to study Venus. I think that we will find the answer someday and unlock the many secrets that Venus' harsh conditons and unfriendly nature have kept hidden for so long. "" Our travels on Earth snd beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" ( paragraph 8) ",5
0cc9cb5,"The electoral college is pointless, I believe that it is just another step that was added to the long process of picking our new president. It causes problems between the people and the government and it takes away time that we could be using to do something actually beneficial to our country. The electoral college is not a place but a group of people who meet and vote for the President and Vice President. Each state gets represented by a certain amount of electors which is decided by the population of that specific state. The electoral college should be thrown out of the way that we choose our president becuase it upsets the people, it can completley change elections, and because it gives to much power to the legislative branch.

I think that the electoral college gets people frustrated with our government. They have to go basically vote for another person to vote. If I lived in texas I would go to a poll and vote for the person that I wanted to put up in the electoral college. That person would then vote for the president. It makes voters, mad why spend time for voteing on people who you dont really care about when you could honeslty just vote for the President who you believe could help our country. The biggest argunment against the electoral college is that it we can't control who our elector votes for. You see when you go to vote for an elector you normally vote for one who says that they are going to vote for the person that you like, but they can change their mind and now you voted for someone that is going to vote for the candidate that you didnt want.

The electoral college can completely change the direction of a vote. Becuase voters only have one vote, the electors represent alot of the states population. For example a single representitive from samller states like Wyoming can represent of to 500,000 voters and in bigger states like California can have up to 55 electors who represent as much as 35 million people. This is why the electoral college can have such a big effect on the voting proces exspecially since the electors represent such a large amount of people. It can become frustrating when a large mass of people ellect some one and that elector changes there mind about? who they vote for, because a group of people as large as 500,000 can be ruiting for one person and the elector can change his mind and now that group 500,000 is voting for someone that they don't like.

Another problem is that the electoral college gives to much power to legislative branch ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy becuase it would have been overthrown by the college. Which meens that the Legislative branch has enough power to create a biased slait. The legislature would create a group of electors that are all in favor of certain idea and you wouldnt be able to vote for anyone else becuase those are the people for your state. The point of voting is to give power to the people and with the electoral college in the way it completely takes that away from us. We get to vote for the electors but that doesnt meen that they are going to vote for the people that we want them to.

Yes the electoral college could have some advanteges like allowing professionals to have an input into what is going on, It helps us avoid run-off elections (elections that end up with a tie), and restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here. If we get rid of the electoral college it will make the people happier and allow them to actually feel like part of the government, It will stabilize elections and not allow the legistaure to change them, and will take away some of the numerous powers that the Legislative branch holds. All in all the electorla cllege os unfair, outdated, and irrational. It need to be abolished!       ?    ",5
0cdf1ff,"Having a new technology that can detect facial expression is not valuable in classrooms. Having technology that can detect when a student is enjoying a specific lesson or action, is not valuable due to the fact that the student's facial expression may have more to do with than just the lesson being learned. The Facial Action Coding System would be able to tell if a student is sad or happy, or frusterated, or disgusted. But it does not have the technology to determine prior emotions, or the cause of them. Therefore, Facial Action Coding Systems are not valuable in classrooms. However they may be useful elsewhere, such as doctors offices, and airports.

Although the author gives a practical use of his product, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a studnet is becoming confused or bored."" Students go through a fair amount of stress throughout the year, and can witness or partake in many activities which can be detromental. This is where the author's claim is no longer valid.

For instance, maybe a second grader gets into school one day, and is distrought because his or her mom and dad got in a divorce the night prior. This is a scenario where the Facial Action Coding System is not going to be able to benefit the kids learning based off of his or her facial expressions. Another example includes highschoolers. What if a boy or girl is being bullied and not reaching for help and bottling all of their emotions in. A system that recognizes facial expression would not be worth having at that time because the system would base its opinion off of what the student is learning, even if the student may be enjoying what they are learning. This is just one case where the Facial Action Coding system would not be valuable.

Although the Facial Action Coding System may not be useful in school classrooms, their is practical application outside of the classroom. For instance, what if a little kid gets signed out of school because they are sick. The mom would most likely take the kid to the doctors to get them examined, if they are truly sick the Facial Action Coding System may be useful to tell if the kid is truly sick, or if they are most likely faking it, prior to the actual visit with the doctor. It may also be useful in principals offices. The Facial Action Coding System may be of use when a student makes a report. If the students emotions can be told as angered, or distraught, it may further prove that the student is actually being truthful, not just trying to get someone in trouble.

Another great use of the Facial Action Coding System is in airports around the world. The system could be of use to tell if someone is of threat or is in an unstable condition prior to boarding the plane. Airport officials could analyze reults of suspected threats before allowing them on a plane. This application would be more practical than it being used in classrooms.

Although I believe that the Facial Coding System is not of use in classrooms, the technology would be great if applied elsewhere. The authors opening sentence in paragraph nine may be the solution to classrooms. ""Putting on a happy face actually works."" This small quote may help lighten a students day more so than a system trying to fix what is wrong by changing what they are learning. ",5
0d18ff3,"Technology can be beneficial in several aspects of everyday life, but reading emotions should not be one of them. According to the article, the technology to read human emotions is possible and can be effiecently used to detect how a person is feeling. This technology is certainly impressive but does not seem very beneficial to the average student and can be seen as slightly intrusive. Therefore, this technology would not be valuable in a classroom due to the small amount of benefit that it would provide and its intrusiveness, as students should have a right to keep certain emotions and feelings to themselves.

It seems unnecessary to use this technology when emotions are already fairly easy to identify without the use of a computer. Body language and facial expressions can already easily be analyzed by humans themselves to reveal emotions. To quote the writer of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto 5). This depicts that technology is not required to identify the basic emotions of a human being and is therefore unnecessary.

If a person is not blatantly showing his emotions with body language and facial expressions, then the person wold likely prefer not to express what he is feeling or thinking. All human beings have a natural right to keep their thoughts and emotions to themselves as they please, and technology that can reveal emotions at their deepest depths can be intrusive. An example of this can be how computers use cookies to track what people are searching on the Internet in order to produce advertisements directed toward the user later on, which often disturbs people and makes them feel uncomfortable. This may be the same situation if computers have access to human emotions. The private feelings of a human should not be exploited by a computer, and therefore trespasses a basic right of humans which allows them to have their own private thoughts and emotions.

The final reason that this technology would not be valuable is because there are little uses for it. Detecting emotions are not really relevant when using a computer. The author of the article states many examples of how this technology can be used on a computer, and the use of using the emotions to determine the type of advertisements would match emotions and what the user is feeling does not seem very important or beneficial. Overall, the implementation of technology into a student's everyday life would not be useful, therefore making it seem pointless rather than valuable.

Therefore, the idea of implementing technology that read emotions would not be valuable in a typical classroom. Despite the consistency of the technology working successful, it would be worthless to bring into everyday lives as people do not need advanced computers to identify other people's emotions. The technology would also be extremely intrusive, as it would exploit the private thoughts and emotions of people that would not want their emotions to be detected and make them feel slightly uncomfortable. Alongside these reasons, there is practically no use for this advanced technology in a typical day of an ordinary student. For these reasons, while the concept of reading emotions may be interesting, there is not much benefit that will come from the use of this technology and therefore implementing it into classrooms would be a prodigious waste of money and effort in order to provide a minimal benefit for students.

0db7e99,"Being in a classroom with a large amount of students can be intimidating. This makes it easier for a student to fall behind in a classroom setting, since they may be too scared to ask a question. One may be thinking, ：what if they laugh at me if I raise my hand?： Or maybe that student may need a different teaching approach, but they do not know how to convey this to them. There could be a solution to this problem. New technology uses a computer that ：constructs a 3-D computer model of the face： (：Making Mona Lisa Smile) it can be used to process the emotions that a student may be feeling. Meaning that technology reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and beneficial.

Reading the emotions of students can help the teachers gather more beneficial data on them. As they constantly say that ：they are not mind readers.： However many students may be embarrased that they are not quite understanding the content. To which this technology could provide some assistance. The computer could simply read and see what percentage of the class is confused. If it is a large percentage then that means the teacher can go over it as a whole class. Also working vise versa meaning that if it is a smaller percentage then the teacher can make smaller groups and provide the needed attention to them. This theory was stated by Dr. Huang, ：＞A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,＞ Dr. Huang predicts. ＞Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor＞： (：Making Mona Lisa Smile：). Although the article refers to online classes the same can be applied to the human interative classroom. The teacher can look at the data during the lesson to check understanding along the way and then provide the extra needed support to those that need it. Then let those that understand it move forward. That way the children don＞t fall behind, and the children that understand the content can be further challenged. Providing a more effective and rigourous courseload.

Another benefit that this technology presents is that it can read the distressing emotions of a student. Especially during the high school years which are very stressful in both the workload and character development. A teacher is able to see if that student is upset, angry, or stressed. Or even a combination of these emotions because ：By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci＞s masterpiece)： (：Making Mona Lisa Smile：). If a student had a particularly stressful event go on in their household they may feel angry, frustrated, and sad. The teacher can then understand that they are going through a moment and be sure to provide some support. Also if the students are feeling especially stressed the teachers may even provide some kind of stress relief day, since prolonged stress can have some serious effects on the human body. This technology may even be able to detect mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety. To which the student can be provided with the support that they need. Possibly leading to the prevention of suicide attempts and anxiety attacks.

In conclusion, having technology in the classroom can be extremely beneficial to both the students and the teachers. It can provide useful data to the teachers. To which they can adjust their teaching plan accordingly, and effectively educate all the students. Futhermore it can help students dealing with mental health issues. Making sure that they get the help and support that they need in order to be the most attentive in the classroom as they can be. As technology continues to be implemented into the teaching program this computer software should be considered as well. ",5
0dd6015,"Dear Senator,

I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will acheive when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us.? Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral collge consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winner-take-all system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will acheive great things for our country.

Thank you for keeping my thoughts in mind,

The growing debate on whether or not the electorial college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electorial college is vitial to the presidential election process becuase it evens out the importance of all the states' votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for toss-up states to vote for the best candiate.(Posner) It can be precieved that the electorial college is a non-democratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people becuase the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electorial college has been around for decaades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come?

The electorial college should be kept becuase it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electorial college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote becuase they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.(Posner) Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty.

Many of the time voters will vote becuase they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electorial college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate becuase they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.(Posner) With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the toss-up staes chose them over the other.

A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electorial college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electorial college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections.

The electorial college is vitial when chosing the presdient becuase it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electorial college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electorial college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electorial college is the best for the president's elections.

Sincerely,

A concerned citizen       ?        ?    ",5
0ec99dd,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile ,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now for this techology to be used in the classroom I have mixed feelings on weather this is appropriate to use. In the other hand it could potentially increase the student body to be more compatiable with being in school and truly enjoying the enviorment and space that they are in. Due to the fact that the teachers know how the students feel or mentally react to on what is happining.

The reason that I feel that this should not be used in school is the fact that it violates all of the personal and private feelings of a student and the lack of emotions it can tell, According to the text it states "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger , disgust, fear and sadness"". There are more emotions than that. One out of the six actually represent something good and happy the other five are more on the sad and unhappy emotions. Another quote from this article states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". If that is true then there would no point in for an emotion to tell you how they truly feel. There is nothing better than another warm blodded person with emotions aswell to say something such as hey i can understand what your going through I feel the same way you didn't have to tell me but I knew.

On the other side of the spectrum and saying how this could benifit the students and the teachers is how to make the class or more engaging to the students. As stated in the article "" "" A classroom computer could recpgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" "" That could help a lot of students especially the ones eho normally dont like school. Plus this machine will potentially make you happier stated in the article "" The Mona Lisa demonstration is realy intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much this computer can do."" This coul help people with persay deppresion and confusion on making a choce or big decision on something.

This manchine the "" Facial Action Coding System"" could help with you arround your freinds or a crush/ significant other on how they truly feel twoards something. Aswell as trying or attempting to make them feel better. In the article stated it sites "" For instance, you could probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"" This could say help the autistic kids who cant read emotions or conversation ques, and understand them so they dont hurt somebodys feelings. Furthermore, the text states "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them. "" Doing so could help your freind whos having a bad day have a happier one or a loved one because thinking and trying to be happy will actually make you happy.

In conclusion in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I have personaly mixed emotions about this being used in schools as seen. Then again my overal feel of this is posiitive and sholud be regulated within schools. Due to how this may impact the teaching area and enivorment to best help the student or just a person in general.",5

However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages; the planet would grealty benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.

Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal,

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates"" (Rosenthal). One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many peole are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcemnt was that congestion (or smog) went down 60 percent. This is a great improvemnt for the city, which is known for having near-record pollution. Multiplying these enforcemnts to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.

The cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article,

Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a care-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky). With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rush-hour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one's destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.

People become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in

Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.

Although cars are useful in order to get to one's destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.    ",5
0f549ce,"The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day. Technology that reads people's emotions would be beneficial in a classroom setting, because it would adjust lesson plans, make learning more fun, and could also help students struggling to focus in class.

The technology to read emotions would greatly change the way students learn. If a teacher used this technology and noticed that all of his students were bored and uninterested, he could alter the lesson plan to make it more fun. Not all students will feel the same, though, which is also where this technology could come in. At the beginning of a school year, perhaps, the teacher could use the technology on the class to see how they feel about the particular subject. Then, the students who are excited about the subject and show interest could be sorted into a class that can be run in a way that makes the class educationally suitable for students who actually want to learn that subject. The students that do not show as much interest, or none at all, could be sorted into a seperate class that makes the subject more fun, but still teaches the same points as the other class.

Another application of such technology in the classroom could help to make learning overall more fun for all students. If many students start to become bored, then the teacher could come up with a quick game to enrich the learning experience. If many of the students are already interested with the subject matter, the teacher may not have to do as much adjusting. If the students need to be enriched with games and activities, now the teacher will immeditely know. This could overall make learning a lot more fun, but introducing more games and activities into the curriculum as see fit. If the students want to play knowledge enriching games, they can just show disinterest, and the system would pick that up and inform the teacher. The technology to read student's emotions in the classroom as a very basic level could make learning more fun and personal to the student.

Reading students emotions would also be helpful to identify those students who are struggling to focus or simply understand the material being presented to them in class. If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously.

Adjusting lesson plans, making learning more fun, and helping struggling students are three of the main reasons in which emotion-reading teachnology would be amazing to introduce into the classroom. The students would control the class, not the teacher, and it would make the learning experience more customized to each particular class. As well, it would allow for more interesting games and activities to be introduced into the curriculum in order to keep learning entertaining and entriching. Students who struggle with particular subjects would be able to recieve help using the technology, and the teacher would not have to guess which students are struggling only based on grades. The technology of emotion-reading should be applied to all classrooms when it becomes widely available, because it could help both teachers and students improve the learning environment. ",5
0f81127,"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefinsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wronga' by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral College?may disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is empahsized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're techniacally not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph six?of ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voters?want to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibilty of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""?Richard A. Posner?states ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one.?If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.       ? ??

0fbd5ba,"Many look up into the sky and see Venus, one of the brightest points in the night sky. While it looks like a star, it is actually a planet. In fact, it is a planet that is extremely difficult to examine closely. According to the author, it is transparent that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers due to the fact that Venus used to be very similar to Earth, the conditions are survivable, and that there are many approaches that can be taken to explore it. The author supports the idea that exploring Venus has immense value well.

Foremost, Venus used to be very similar to Earth. Scientists can research Venus and discover its differences and similarities to Earth. Paragraph four of the article states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This demonstrates that astronomers are curious about Venus's transformation from a once Earth-like planet to an inhospitable planet. Paragraph four also states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This is crucial because space travel can often take long periods of time. The travel time to Venus will not take nearly as long as other space endeavors.

In addition, Venus's conditions can be survivable to humans. If the expeditions are controlled and cautious, endeavors to Venus are definitely possible. In the article, paragraph five says,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would alllow scientists to float above the fray."" NASA's plan for trips to Venus would be similar to having a spacecraft hovering over Venus's atmosphere. Paragraph five also proclaims, ""air pressure would be close to that of sea level at Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that the journey and process will not be extremely hazardous. The conditions at thirty miles above Venus's atmosphere would be simlar to the condtions on Earth. The dangers are not present at this altitiude and astronomers are still able to collect useful data.

Moreover, there are many other innovative approaches to studying Venus. Paragraph seven states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions."" This displays how researchers can explore Venus's surface without risking human lives. This method is safe and nonhazardous toward humans and is necessary to advance the research of Venus. Paragraph six declares, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough missionto understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are building machines to decrease levels of risk and contribute insightful knowledge to the cause, which makes exploration seem all the more desirable.

Overall, expeditions to Venus are valuable. Gaining statistics about Venus will not only be helpful for scientists analyzing Earth but also with future space missions. Venus is close and similar to Earth. Exploration is survivable and can be safe with the right technology. The author presents these ideas thoroughly and accurately to inform that space travel to Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus, one of the brightest ""stars"" in the sky, will lead travels from Earth beyond doubts and towards innovation.",5
0fc8125,"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

0feef16,"Limited car usage has plenty of advantages. A few examples of advantages that come from limited car usage are lessining the amount of gases polluting the air, also it would create a friendly and neighborly enviorment, and a large amount of money would be saved.

To limit car usage has huge benefits; we can lessen the gasses that are polluted, lessening smog. It may not sound like something that effects your everyday life, but it does. Smog and air pollution are a problem, and a threat to our safety and well being. As of right now it is'nt a life or death situation, but if car usage continues to be a huge part of the world, all the air pollution from all the years of driving are going to get so bad people, and the earths atmosphere will be extremly affected by it. Think about your kids future, would you really want them to live in a world consumed by air pollution, and emission gasses, and smog.. To give an example, ""passneger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states"" (rosenthal). That just showing how much car usage affects air pollution and the air we breath everyday. Just decreasing the amount of car usage can reduce the smog, and air pollution in cities and towns.

Additionally, the less cars are used the more people and neighbors would intteract. If a majority of a town just lessened the amount they go out using a car, they would walk, or ride bikes, or take busses, etc.. imagine your town, and families and their kids taking a walk somewhere, or people riding their bicycles to their destination, everyone could meet their neighbors and talk. Overall, cities and towns and suburben areas would generally become just a friendly enviorment. Most people want to live in a place in which they feel safe and neighborly. Teenagers and families would get more excersise then the normal. Due to having to walk, and ride bikes or other things they would be getting out of the house more instead of sitting in a car then going and sitting some place then going back home and sitting around again, they would get the needed physical activity to stay some what healthy. ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day""(selsky). That is amazing, and it is so good for people to get out and do things like that. Lessening car usage could completly change neighborhoods and towns and citiies.

Finally, Cars in the united states are highly expensive, and not everyone has thousands of dollars around to get the car they want/need. ""Cash strapped americans could not afford new cars""(Rosenthal). Just an example that cars are not cheap and a lot of people spend money they do not have on cars. In addition to buying the car, gas must be provided, depending on the car and the amount of gas it uses up, that can be pretty expensive. Insurance is another cost, everyone has to have insurance to be able to drive and own a car, thats a monthly fee coming out of our pockets. Limiting car usage could save a lot of money, it would leave extra money every day, week or month to go out and eat once in a while, or to buy other necisities. Just about everyone wants to have a little extra money, but with a car thats frequently used can use up almost 200 to 400 dollars each month. Riding a bike, or skateboarding or just simply walking is completly free.

Advantages in limited car usage are, The decrease in gas pollution and smog, it could create friendlier neighborhoods and towns, and lastly thousands of people would save a lot of money.       ??????       ?       ?    ",5
102d4b2,"This new peice of technology called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, is able to show peoples emotions and tell when people are hiding and masking their emotions. It is a new peice of technology developed by Prof. Thomas Huang, and Prof. Nicu Sebe. This product is revolutionary in many diffrenf ways. It not only valuable to a modern day life, but it also could have many real-world and technilogical applications.

The FACS system is a new and valuable peice of technology that has many interesting and strong applications. Like it was said im the text, it could adjust an assignment for a student to make it more engaging for them. ?A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,? Dr. Huang predicts. ?Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'Alto). That would make teachers lifes easier, and have less annoyed and out of control students, because they would be doing an assignment they would want to do, and not be extremely bored throughout class. Another way this could be valuable is for when cops do lie detector test. They would be able to pick up movements in the face that could show them that they are lying, or not telling the whole story. There are also many real world applications for this technology out there.

The FACS made by Prof. Thomas Huang could have many real world applications that would make life easier or more fun for some people. One of the many real world applications for this system would be Police Videos. You would be able to see the emotions on the criminal's face while he was being recorded on video, helping the police aid in the investigation. Another brought up by the article could be politics. You would be able to see how the politician is feeling, or which emotions. You would also be able to tell if they are faking emotions they are emitting while they are giving a speech, or if they are outright lying to you. The article itself says ""To an expert, faces don?t lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ?smiling? politician or celebrity isn?t being truthful."" (D'Alto). The final point I want to bring up is how this could be used for therapy or working through yout problems.

The FACS system could be a great peice of technolgy for therapists to use, working posple through their issues. People could tell how angry or depressed you were actually feeling. It would be a good way to work through the problems you have been facing, because people would know how you are feeling. The machine is able to sense the emotions you have been feeling, so people would be there to comfort you and work through your emotional turmoil. It would make venting about your problems much easier, and less hard to agknowledge

The FACS system is an important and valuable peice of technology for people to use that will most likely become valuable in the near future. It has countless applications, from Police work to Emotional Therapy. In conclusion, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nibu Sebe has most likely make an invalubale innovation in the scientific feild with many real world and scientific innovations.",5
1032c21,"You and your friends and family could often have arguments on whether something is real or not, such as in movies. Some might think one thing is special effects, others will think it is real. In Unmasking the Face on Mars, the author explains controversy of the ""face"" found on Mars' surface. It became an icon once it was released to the public. It was highlighted for decades and the society argued over it being an alien making, or just a land form called a mesa. The face was just a natural landform and it shouldn't have been thought as an alien form.

The most logical answer to this was that it was a mesa, and that the shadows on the surface happened to make it look like a human face of an egyptian pharaoh. This struck civilization in the late 70s and caused a lot of arguments. The people that thought is actually was an alien structure were just people of the press who just wanted attention. A Mars Global Surveyor "" snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared an a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quotes directly states and gives evidence that it is just a natural landform.

There isn't even any true or logical evidence that the face on Mars was an "" alien artifact."" It was just a rumor that went around to keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies. The cameras even took a picture with a ten times better resolution than the 1976 picture of the face. In addition, the new picture even had each pixel in the image span 1.56 meters in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel. Garvin talks that "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" and that "" if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Garvin directly states here that no matter what, the formation couldn't have possibly been an alien formation or even a pyramid. This is even more proof that it is ridiculous to think that the formation was an "" alien making .""

Although the face was thought to be alien, there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't. Scientists would wish that it was an extra terrestrial sign, but the odds of that are too scarce to even consider. This was a very controversial topic, as I have stated before. All of the theorists out there had many different and unique opinions of it. The narrator says what the image "" actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landfroms common around the American West. "" It remeinds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin."" This evidence gives even further support that it isn't extra terrestrial, and states that it isn't, shich exposes that it is a fluke.

The face on Mars was an ongoing argument for years to come once it was released to the public. There was no reason to do so. There was already valid points that gave proof of it being just a mesa. Things like this occurence happen all the time, even in your daily life. If things like this run across your mind, think about it the logical way and not a very, very unlikely path about it. There may be similarities between the sides, like in this argument. But, there was too much to show that it favored the more realistic side of it.

The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another gadget, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may clome along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the cirriculum because they do not understand the way it is being taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because the aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teaher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a nutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is being taught, the teacher could re-word the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored of the material then the teacher may need to make some assgnment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students get exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could suggest way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be avalible in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article give instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environment when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in class rooms may improve the teavhing style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.

1085852,"The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed. This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote.

There is a disaster factor.? According to ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people. Some people may argue that the states know what they are doing and are cautious on who to pick, but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting.

When you vote, there is a slight possibility of a tie occuring. If this were to happen, the state delegations would vote on which president. Each state will cast one vote, which is not fair because of the amount of representives in different states. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" is stated in source 2. Some people may say that the bigger states are helpful with voting because the Electoral College will balance out what the large states loss by the population votes. This still isn't fair because this is saying that the smaller states with less representatives do not have much say in the voting and this will turn off potential voters.

Some presidents may have a stronger appeal to some states then others. It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power. ""...such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,"" is stated in source 3. This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states. This is like the winner takes it all, they may know that they have no chance in winning. (Obama did end up winning and was titled as the 44th President of the United States. To others, they may say that each persons vote does count but it doesn't seem like it. The voters in the South didn't see any campaign ad by Romney which was not fair because he was not concerned about them not voting for him.

The Electoral College is not a fair process. It worked in the past, but not anymore. Using the popular vote process is more fair for all of the people. They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events. We need to encourage potential voters because one day, when they become older, they will be the voters of our country.    ",5
10b6508,"Imagine a day where there will be no driver at the steering wheel of a car, problems would eventually arise, specially if there are accidents and people don't know who to blame. Driverless cars that exist today are not entirely driverless, they someone who can take comand if there are traffic problems or construction ahead. Everyday technology advances more and more, some companies believe that in the future there will be cars that opeate by themselves without the need of having someone there incase of a problem, some companies even have a prediction for when such cars will come out into the market. Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road.

First of all, Driverless cars shouldn't be be on the road because they will not be able to operate correctly if there is a problem in the raod. Driverless cars today still need someone there incase there are problems in the road that only humans can take care of, how will a car know what to do in this type of situation, they don't think like people. There are situations that could happen while a driverles car is on the road that sometimes can not be foreseen, therefore the car cannot be programed for such situation. Humans normally know what to do if there are roads constructions ahead or there is something on thee road, like a ditch to avoid, and in these situations how can a car 'see' what goes on in the road. Even if the cars were to have sensors for the outside, what about the inside, if there was a problem with the passanger the car wouldn't be able to tell what to do.

Additionally, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road because how would law apply to them. There are many accidents that happen in the road every day, law is applied in this situations to know who is to take the blame and what to do.

In the situation of a driverless car it would be dificult to pinpoint how law would apply to them, if an accident were to happen, would the manufacturer or the driver be the one to take the balme. There isn't even a driver in this car, and sometimes technology malfunctions occur, so no one could really take the blame. With time anything can malfunction, but if an accident that involves death is to occur how would the problem be managed if there is only a car, technology, to blame and take resposibility.

Most importantly, driverless cars shouldn't be on the road beacuse there will be too many expenses. If there would be driverless cars in the future, how much would you be charged for being taken somewhere by such a car. In today's world there is almost always a cost in order to get any type of service, the drverless car would, most likely, have a cost in order to be used, and at first that wouldn't be cheap. A driverless car would steal chaufers jobs, and sometimes those jobs are all that sustain some people, so this car would make many not have a way to get paid. At first when this cars are being constructed, how will they be paid for, each city would probably have to spend a vast amount of money to get this cars so they can start operating.

In conclusion, Driverless cars shouldn't be on the road. If these cars were on the road there will be too many expenses, how would law apply to them, and they won't be able to operate correctly if there is a problem on the road. There will be many problems with these cars, and conflicts will be harder to slove with them. If they are released into the market, a person should first think of all the things and conflicts that may arise just because of one car before using it.",5
111b844,"More companies are pouring in more and more money trying to make the perfect driveless cars but pursuing the driveless car is a negative thing for car manufacturing should not be pursued. Developing driveless cars could make driving easier but is a neagtive thing becuase there is a big safety concern, it can make driving boring, and it still requires the assitance of the driver.

Driveless cars have huge and complicated safety risk. Driveless cars are not perfectly save and can cause major problems when driving in places with construction or complicated traffics or complicated driving routes and if the driver does not take control of the car, the driver and the passengers in the cars and other people can get seriously injured. Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems. Driveless cars are dangerous and can be hazardous to the driver and the people around the driver and also leave you to deal with the consequences of an accident.

Driveless may seem cool at first, being able to drive all by thereself and not needing the help of any real person but what does that do to the driver. With driveless cars it makes driving cars for the driver boring. Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk.

Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true. These so called driveless cars are not driveless car but are cars that can do basic functions of driving but when anything hard pops up, the driver has to drive the driveless car. This is a real problem becasue having a driveless car should mean that the car should be able to drive without the help of the driver but they can not and make the driver just sit there in the driver seat, staring out the window waiting and getting bored, so they can drive the driveless car when it is in a hard driving condition and if they do not do that they are in risk of a harazardous accident. One of the most technonlgical advances car made by BMW, is a driveless car and is suppose to be driveless car but is it really, the car can only handles speeds up to 25 miles per hour and any faster and the driver has to take over and even when the car is driving itself the driver needs to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel. These self proclaimed driveless cars may look like driveless car but they are not, they require as much assiatant from a real person as non-driveless cars do.

Companies all over the world are spending money to make the best driveless car out there but is it really worth it. Driveless cars are not a positive aspect to the automotive industry but is a negative aspect of the industry. These so called driveless cars need the assistance of real life human drivers as much or even sometimes more then regular non-driveless cars, these driveless car also are extremely boring to drive and ride for the driver adn companies can't find a way to fix it, and last but not least these driveless cars are hazardous. These cars can cause accidents, can not deal with hard driving, and can leave you with the consequnces of a horrible accident. Driveless cars might sound amazing and awesome part of the future but it is an negative aspect of the automotive industry and letting that negative aspect get s foothold in the future will be disatorous.

112723e,"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years.? More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline.? In Robert Duffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with.? In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars.? The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage.? In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""(Duffer 16) This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel.? Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket.? Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment.? In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.S(Rosenthal 5).? This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars.? By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs.? A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.(Rosenthal 37)""? A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that.? The encouragement of governments to suggest car-pooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls.? If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road.? Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.(Rosenthal 40)? Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once.? With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year.? Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.(Selsky 20)By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars.? With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road.? Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored.? Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.(Rosenthal 35) Because of this,? people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family.? This has created a domino effect; people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society.? They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues.? By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.       ?    ",5
11428cc,"Although the year is 2016 and we were promised hoverboards, flying cars, automatic tieing shoes, and self fitting jackets by 2015, we arent exactly falling behind in the race of technology. With driverless cars we are one step closer to a much safer, and easier driving experience. In the not to distant future we wont have to make dad stay awake the whole drive to Disney world just to make it there on time. We no longer will have to hop in our vehicles when we are moving and have to go back and forth and back and forth from our old home to the new. Instead all that will be required of us is to pack the car full of items and ship out the car and have someone ready to unload it.

And watch out BP! With the new driverless cars we will being making half as many stops for gas than we have ever had to before! Last, but most definatly not least important is your safety. In the new smart driverless cars accedents are surely to drop a hefty percent. Keep your eyes on the horrizon, or close them and take a nap while the the car takes the wheel.

Everyone can relate to those long hauls to out of state, whether it be for vacation, visiting relatives, or work. The most memorable part, for myself at least, was wondering where we were going to stop and sleep, or if dad was going to just keep on driving. That will be something of the past in the not so distant future. As of now the cars we have can drive on there own.. Most of the time. There are still some trouble spots such as traffic jams, work zones, and accidents. In the previously stated mishaps the current versions of the cars will promptly alert the driver that there may be an upcoming event in which they will have to intervene.

Gas in the surrounding area currently is sitting around $2.75. From what I know the average car can hold somewhere around 30 gallons of gas. Lets say you fill up your tank and ride until its empty and then fill it up again, and lets also say that it takes you about a week to empty your tank. So on monday you fill it up for around $82.50. Come next weeks monday you need to fill up for another $82.50. In a span of two weeks you have spent $165.00. There are about 4 weeks in a month so that will be $330.00 a month. But you dont just drive your car for a month, so for a year you will be paying roughly $3960 a year! In the new driverless cars they can take that almost $4000 and cut it down to around $2000 since with the technology in the new cars you will be stopping in at a gas station about half as many times as you would be if you were driving in one of the old cars.

The complany Google has sent out a fleet of driverless cars already (with drivers in them ready to take the wheel at any given moment.) to help further the progress towards these great machines. They have driven around half a million miles (500,000 miles!) and are yet to crash. Google＞s Toyota Prius is modified with position-estimating sensores on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. With this massive combonation of the latest technology we can say goodbye to blindspots for good!

Safety, luxery, money. All three of those are what the new smart driverless cars are offereing. It is almost our duty to open our arms to the advance of this technology. With Google at the helm of the team that will bring us the cars we need and deserve, they will be in the news quite soon.",5
120cb91,"I believe that the negative aspects of driverless cars outweigh the positive ones. There are too many complications and problems that are yet to be solved. Driverless cars are a very unique and interesting invention, but I am not in favor of the development of these cars. There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly.

Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.

I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars.

Lastly, driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. With this, you would need to figure out an effective way to alert your driver when their assistance is needed. If the driver could not be alerted, then this could lead to massive consequences. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote highlights the neccesity of getting the driver's attention. If in any case the driver was not able to be alerted, the repercussions would be severe.

In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. ",5
12309f9,"Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of ""The Challenge Exploring Venus,"" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to ""intimidating endeavors."" The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well by using previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics that catch the readers attention.

The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand. He mentions, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.

The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus. The article mentions that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus."" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.

Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.             ",5
12a1427,"That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the ""face""that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,""The ?Face on Mars? has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows?even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).

It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.

If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around??It?s not easy to target Cydonia,? says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.

Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,? says Garvin. ?That?s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.? This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.

Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.

There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a ""werid"" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool. I guess we will have to keep looking on other planents to find live or ""aliens"" because so far it is for sure not on mars!",5
131a75b,"Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.

Schools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. ""For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different."" What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.

The article states, "" ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor."" "" Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."". A student will most likely do better just having a teacher because of the facial expressions or body language a teacher gives while teaching can help them better retain the information given rather than a screen teaching it to them, and if a teacher is doing a lecture in front of a class there is no need for a student to have out a laptop computer or an ipad unless it is called for that class and the teacher would be able to answer questions, not the computer.

The Facial Action Coding System software should not be used in the classroom. It is not of value to a student's education, it would be a waste of money and time to install it onto student ipads or computers. It is a complete invasion of privacy to today's youth to be constantly looked at through a little camera just to see if they are confused or not when they could just simply raise their hand and ask a teacher. Though it has many benefits, it has more pros than cons.

13f75ec,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this proccess in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with thier own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This proccess would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidencey,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winner-takes-all system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

United States Citizen.    ",5
14706c7,"Highways, roads, streets; they are everywhere. No matter where you are or what part of town, these are always found nearby. Wherever roads are found, so are cars. People have been driving vehicles since the 1950's and over time, have had many positive effects on the world; but they have also had many negative effects. Luckily, the government has been helping to reduce car usage to save the world. Limiting car usage helps the world become a better place by decreasing pollution and keeping individuals active.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars make up ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"" and can be responsible for ""50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). These percentages show how much humans rely on cars, which is negatively impacting countries. Greenhouse gases are extremely awful for the environment, and if they are not decreased significantly, then the Earth could become a bad place for existance. In many places, government officials have been trying to limit the percentage coming from cars, which has helped greatly. Rosenthal claimed in a different article, The End of Car Culture, that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was...equal to where the country was in January 1995."" The drop of this percentage has decreased the amount of greenhouse gases in the world. Many events all over the world have contributed to the lower percentage. For example, the Car-Free Day in Bogota, Columbia has been a huge hit since the mid 1990's and is continuing to grow each year (Andrew Selsky, Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). This activity along with others will continue to bring the percentage down until it is hopefully extremely small.

Fast food and the lack of exercise has increased the number of obese people greatly. With a lack of transportation, there is a bigger opportunity for individuals to eat healthier and exercise more. Andrew Selsky, a writer from the Seattle Times published an article about Bogota's Car-Free Day. He confirmed that ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths,"" (Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). The building of new sidewalks has increased the number of people using them each day. With more people walking and exercising, the rate of obesity should decrease dramatically. Not only is exercising important, but eating healthy is as well. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities in Germany are now stating, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). Since there can only be a limited number of shops in the city because they have to be close by, healthier options have been chosen more often, keeping people in shape. Not only do the individuals look healthier, but they feel better.

Saving the Earth and other people are two huge causes for limiting car usage. Keeping both alive and healthy can keep everyone happy and safe. Reducing car usage has great advantages and all humans should consider different methods of transportation; walking, bking, or even carpooling are great alternatives to help the world. It may not seem like it now, but the decision of limiting car usage can be a life or death situation.    ",5
14a1792,"Many people believe that there should be technology in a classroom, but do we really need technology that reads emotions. The Facial Action Coding System is the system that was designed by scientists to read emotions. They believe that teachers could use this system for lessons online. Even though it could help teachers, it shouldn't be used in a class. This technology could have many flaws that would produce false readings. Especially when reading kids emotions. This technology does help in many ways, but there are some things that humans have to do by them selves.

Teachers need to stop relying on technology to teach. A teacher should be required to take classes that can help them become a better teacher and to help them with reading emotions. Instead of them using the Facial Action Coding System to find out kids emotions they should take a psychology class. That class will teach them what they need to know about humans. Especially humans going through adolesence. Once those teachers understand how emotions work they wont have to rely on a technology that isn't flawless.

The Facial Action Coding System has so many flaws in it that prevent it from being useful. The article states that this technology can recognize when a student is confused or bored. The problem with that is the fact that a person can fake emotions. If the students wanted to try to be funny they could mess with the system and change something that was working. In the article, Dr. Huang said, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective teacher."" An effective teacher wouldn't change something just because a couple people ar bored or confused. This system also doesn't factor in the chances of someone having a bad day. If someone is having a bad day confused emotions could already be happening before the lesson. This would mess everything up.

I understand that some people aren't natural psychologists, and don't know how to read emotions. These people can just take there time and teach themselves how to read them. Even though not all teachers have the knowledge learned through psychology, they all should. People naturally believe that technology can help. It can help, and thats why it is understandable to want the Facial Action Coding System to be used by school. There are better alternatives to this system. The author stated, ""we can write down simple instructions the ""encode"" different emotions."" If people can do that then, why aren't they doing it?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in school. It has no value to learning. The better alternative is to make teachers do things themselves. Teachers should learn how to read emotions. They also need to learn that you can't always rely on a system that is not flawless. A teachers job is to teach and not to sit and let technology run their classroom. So if schools want a type of technology that isn't valuable, they can use it all they want, but if they want something that has value they should teach their teachers how to read emotions.",5
14a6a23,"In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo of what seemed to be a face on the surface of Mars. The Face on Mars caused speculation of alien life on Mars. However, the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

One of the reasons that the Face on Mars looks like a face is because of shadows that cause the illusion of facial features. A few days after the Face on Mars was discovered, NASA released the image to the public. On the image was a caption, which stated that the Face was just a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" These shadows that were noted in the caption can easily create the illusion of a human head.

Adding to this, the Viking 1's camera quality was low compared to what we have today. So, the picture isn't all too clear. Every pixel in the clearest picture captured by the Viking 1 covers 43 meters. That's a low resolution compared to other spacecrafts that have photographed the face. One of these spacecrafts is the Mars Global Surveyor. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time in April 5, 1998. When the spacecraft flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times clearer than that of the Viking 1 picture. When the picture was released to the public, it revealed a natural landform. The Face on Mars was nothing more than a rock formation.

Although the pictures were clear, many people say that the pictures taken by the Mars Global Surveyor are unreliable due to them being taken in 1998. The reason for this is that, in 1998, it was winter where the Face was located, which caused a cloudy atmosphere. The Mars Global Surveyor had to peer through the clouds in order to see the Face. This led to many people not being satisfied with the pictures taken. Many skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the clouds. The claims that the skeptics made were refuted, however.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough to take a second look, and pictures were taken. On that day, there weren't any clouds due the season being summer in Cydonia. On top of there being no obstacles to obscure the vision of the camera, the picture's resolution was at the maximum it could be. Each pixel spanned only 1.56 meters, compared to the Viking 1's picture. The picture revealed the Face to be a landform, just like the other pictures that were taken after the Viking 1 picture. The landform turned out just to be the equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are common in the American West. These landforms happen to be very common in Cydonia, which is why scientists came to the conclusion that it was a mesa before they had even taken more photos. The only difference between this mesa and another one is the shadows it casts, which causes the mesa to look like a face.

In short, the Face on Mars isn't a sign of alien life. Although it looked like a human head, it's really just a mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.   ",5
14d1bfc,"So the other day I was working at NASA just like everyday and something was brought up that I had never heard before. What was brought up was that back in the 70's, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a top region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The person who said this out loud said it was just formations called butte or mesa's which are very common around the American West. What happened was pretty normal at NASA. One of my co workers blurted out it was probably created by aliens. More people started agreeing with him because how else could a human looking face get on a planet that nobody ever talked about. It started to have me thinking about space and all the crazy things that happen, so I decided to do some research when I got home. I looked around the internet, and went to the public library to look for some books about rock formatons on different planets. Once I got those, I finally began research and what I found was shocking. I believe that the face on Mars is not and ancient alein artifact because rock formations form on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed.

I believe that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because rock formations form on every planet. research has shown that the face found on Mars looksv like lanforms common around the American West. As far as people know, that face could have just gotten there from some sort of sand storm on the big red planet back in the 70's. Another thing that people shold know is that pictures can be deceving.

I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact because pictures can be deciving. What scientist knew back then, and what they know now is a lot different. There is much more technological advances now then there were back then, so the picture quality from space wasn't very good. It was very pixelated, not clear, and didn't give very much information. It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head but thats just not the truth. The picture quality now is at the highest its ever been so people can see pictures a lot more clearly. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the image was very deceving and not many people could figure out what it most likely looked like. One more thing that people should really know is that there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.

I believe that the face on Mars was not an anciet alien artifact because there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed. Back in the 70's people thought that aliens were real because the technology wasn't very good, and people olny believed what they were told. In the latest years though, Scientists have no evidence that aliens are real. This proves that there couldn't have been an anciet cicilization of aliens.

Because of these facts, I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact becaue rock formations can be found on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.",5
14e0d1b,"Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.

School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.

Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.

Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.

The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole.",5
1549de8,"Senator of the State of Florida,

The Electoral College has been a part of our country since is was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. Although it has been used for so long and some what effectivley, I believe that the act of changing the process to election by popular vote would benefiet the country and the residents more. Many poeple do think that the Electoral College is more fair and is better because of its certain outcome and other good aspects. My belief about the Elecotral College differs. I believe it is unfair and outdated, and I am not alone on that opinion.

An argument against the Electoral college is the disaster factor, information from the passage

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. In 2000, the biggest election crisis took place in a century. In 1960, segregationists almost had success in replacing electors with people who would benefiet them. Along with that, some electors may not be truthful and defy those who they are electing for and elect the opposer. All these examples come with fault in the system.

Another example from the same article claims that the idea of a tie is the most unsettling. The election would be put into the hands of the House of Representatives. An argument for the Electoral College claims the chance of a tie is very unlikely, but it has come close before. In 1968 and in 1976, a small shift would've cost the election. On the other hand, it would be much more difficult to tie a popular vote, seeing that there are far more citizens than electors for the college.

There are claims that the Electoral College is both fair and unfair for different reasons. People claim that it is fair because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, when a popular vote might, from the article

In Defense of the the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. However, the process is unfair as well. In result of a winner-take-all system in the states, the presidental candidates don't spend time in states they know they don't have a chance in. This is unfair to voters because not all states get to see the candidates at all. Swing states have all the focus on them. These states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns. This is not fair because those running for the position will focus more on those states. With a popular vote, the candidates will want to contact each state to make sure those who reside there have paid attention to them and will hopefully vote for those people.

The process of the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and risky. There are so many opportuntities for disaster and a lot of unfairness all around. With people relying on the fact that the chances are slim or disaster is unlikely to happen is just not smart and there are things we can do about it. With a popular vote, a fair count is given and the president who more people choose will take office. Our country is a whole, and we treat the process of election like it isn't. Let the population decide and it's a fair trial; let a few electors decide and it could lead to disaster. Thank you.    ",5
158ddca,"The author of this passage has supported his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers extremely well. The reasons he supports himself well is by stating how Venus was probably the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and how it would be a good challenge for scientists to accept.

In paragraph four, the author asks this question, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" The author answers the question by saying how Venus might have been like Earth. This statement sparked curiosity among the scientists, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" With this statement, scientists are eager to find out if this is true, and if it is, what happened to the life forms? The author proves that Venus being similar to Earth is worth the dangers. Knowing what happened to the life forms on Venus may help prevent the same disaster happening on Earth.

The main dangers of visiting Venus is the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the extreme surface temperature, and the unbelivable atomospheric pressure. To continue research on Venus, scientists would have to get up close. The author uses the word ""challenge"" instead of ""risk."" This describes how pursuing Venus would be innovational to mankind. The author supports this claim by talking about how researchers are testing new technology to continue work on Venus. ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" When scientists achieve this goal and do research on Venus, who knows what is next in space exploration. Venus being a challenge to study is worth the dangers because if scientists conquer this, they will be able to conquer anything.

In conclusion, the author supported their idea extremely well with concrete evidence that exploring Venus is worth the risk. With the satement that Venus could have held life forms and water shows that studying this planet is neccessary. Also, when we study Venus, it will prove that humanity can face any challenge that comes its way.  ",5
15b1360,"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one will have any money because of ""Driverless Cars"". Yes, you may think driverless cars is a good idea but its not. We already have ""Driverless Cars"", they are taxis and buses. They say it would use half the fuel of today's taxis and are more flexible than a bus. But how much would they cost? Are they going to be cheaper than a taxi? Are they going to be bigger than a bus?

Buses and taxis are probaly the cheapest forms of transport, and don't get me started on Ubers.

They say that Google has already made some ""Driverless Cars"", but they are not really driverless. Driverless means no one behind the wheel. ""They alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If it can't drive through traffic or back out of driveways then what's the point. What's the point of having a ""Driverless Car"" if it's not really driverless. Isn't the whole point of having a driverless car to relax and let it drive on it's own, not to be alerted when it can't even pull up into your driveway.

""Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" So what you're telling me is that you want to make the roads smarter too? No, you need to make humans smarter not cars or roads. If we weren't so lazy we wouldn't need ""Driverless Cars"". ""The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" Want if the ""human at the wheel"" sucks at driving?

Then we are going to have some issues.

The sensors are what the should be adding to cars. The sensors ""Can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better respone and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

See that is what we need in cars, they are so many car accidents because of speeding and drunk driving.

Ok back to why ""Driverless Cars"" souldn""t be made. Driverless cabs? They already driverless cabs, you, yourself are not driving the cab. Unless you are a cab driver you are not driving the cab, and it's going to take so many jobs away from cab drivers. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to driver?"" Their turn to drive? So you take turns driving your brand new driverless car? But don't worry they have a in-car-entertaimnet and information system to make sure you don't fall asleep at the wheel. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" I thought it was a driverless car why would the driver be at fault?

I can talk about this ""Driverless Cars"" idea for hours but I only have fifty-five minutes to talk about this. So i'm just going to wrap this up with my last thought. Driverless cars sould not be made.

15dede4,"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it would allow teachers to know when students become confused, are being dishonest, or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.

In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student.

School behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. In the excerpt, the author writes, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" (D'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.

Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto). This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read.

1608b25,"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",5
165914d,"Venus is a interesting but amazing planet. It has a nickname of the ""Evening Star"". It is the planet that is the closest related to earth, which makes sense for it also being referred to as Earth's ""twin."" It being so closely related to our home planet has caught the eye of some. It is a planet no one can get close to however some think it is worth some risks to discover what lies there. You may be thinking what risks are there? Well there are quite a few. The author does a great job explaining what the risks are and how harsh Venus can be. However I do not believe they explained enough of the benefits that support why we should explore it despite the risk factor involved.

For Venus being Earth's ""twin"" it's very different from earth. The author included the facts of the atmosphere of Venus is made up of almost ninty-seven percent of carbon dioxide and it's clouds have highly corrosive sulferic acid in them. Earth does not have either of those and humans breathe oxygen and in return produces carbon dioxide. Humans really couldn't benefit from the lack of oxygen compared to the almost ninty-seven percent carbon dioxide. The almost other three percent may not even be oxygen but the author doesn't include that detail. Earth doesn't have an average of over 800 degress on its surface unlike Venus. The author then included that the pressure is 90 times greater on Venus then it is on Earth, that pressure can crush a submarine.

There is even more that prevent us from discovering more on Venus. The weather there can and will include erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning storms. Which is really not ideal at all for trying to explore.

NASA is working on ways to get up close with Venus. According to the passage they have been testing different electronics made of silicon carbide in chambers simulating the conditions on Venus. They discovered it could last up to three wees. Their other idea was to have scientists float above the fray. But they couldn't take rocks samples or anything by doing so. It would be a good way, but they really couldn't get the research they wanted. As well as the fact it wouldn't be easy conditions because of the radiation.

According to the author, Astromers are very interested in Venus because at one point they believe it was ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They believe it was covered with oceans and even sustained life just like Earth does now. In current day they know that it still does have similarities to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. But is that really all worth it?

The author then says the value of returning there is indisputable. The author really included a lot more risks than benefits of returning there. The support they gave wasn't that supportive. Then would say something beneficial for example, they could actually observe from the fray but they only have limited sight of the planet. It really just adds to the negative part of the exploration. The article seemed to have more negativity than positivity. The risks drowned out the support which in turn made the author's point not as strong.             ",5
16bf5a2,"The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don't realize the negatives it has on our environment, local buisnesses, and people's lives in general. Transporation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars; the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local buisnesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.

Although cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is without-a-doubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source #2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with even-numbered licenses from driving; this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.

Furthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local buisnesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local buisnesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance; The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.

Another advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we'd expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn't a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you'll soon understand why having a car isn't always necessary.

All in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we'd see smog in our skies clear out, your local buisnesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you'll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time.    ",5
1750767,"Dear senator

The Electoral College should be kept for the voting of the President. There are many reasons to support this conclusion. When the people vote for a President, they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This can be a good and bad thing. The good thing is that the Electoral College keeps balance. The bad part is that some Americans see that is unfair that they cannot vote for a President directly.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politicial balance between small and large states (as it says in paragraph 21). This means that it makes sure the election is fair, not one person can be voted president just because they campaigned in a larger state (more people). The Electoral College also balances out the winners. They are the people who pick the clear winner when two candidates get tied. This happened to Nixon and Clinton. They both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes (as it says in paragraph 22). In these kind of situations it is good to have a backup plan (also known as the Electoral College).

Although the Electoral College is a helpful and fair way to vote, some Americans do not see it that way. In fact,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (as it says in paragraph 9). There reasoning is that they cannot vote directly. They vote for a slate of electors who then vote for the president. They see this as unfair and think that they should be able to vote for the president directly. Below the 14th paragraph, it? says ""lost the presidency: In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more indivisual votes than George W. Bush nationwide,but Bush won the election,recieving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266.""

Although this may seem unfair, the reality of it is that the Electoral College is just trying to keep the election for President fair. The Electoral College help to ensure that all of the candidates for President have a fair advantage. If the Electoral College wasnt there to balance out the votings, then the candidates could cheat. By cheat, this means that they could campaign in a bigger place of they could be from a different place than another president and have a unfair advantage because of the bigger population. If one president was from Texas and the other was from Florida, the candidate from Texas would have a unfair advantage because hes from a place with a bigger population. Why this is unfair is because if a candidate is from a area with a big population, the people in that area are most likely going to vote more towards that candidates side. In the last sentence of paragraph 21, it says ""Alarge state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states.""

In the end, there are always going to be downfalls. The Electoral College may pick the opposite candidate that the majority of the people want, this is true. Also, the people may feel that it is wrong to not go with the peoples opinion. If the Electoral College was not there to decide, there would be all forms of chaos. As it says 18-22, the candidates would have an unfair advantage. The situations on both ends have cons but the Electoral College staying solves more problems than creating them.       ?       ?

175775c,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"". While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the ""cons"" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument.

From the beginning of their argument, the author states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours"" and that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". The usage of these statements creates a negative image, which can lead readers to believe that the exploration of Venus is too dangerous to enagage in. Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as ""thick atmosphere"", ""corosive sulfuric acid"", ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"", and ""extreme"", they influence readers negatively as well.

Similarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus. Despite claiming that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives.

As the author continues with their argument, readers become increasingly aware that Venus is likely not as beneficial as the author intends to make it seem. With an unlivable biome and dangerous atmospheric conditions, Venus is likely far too hazardous to explore at this time in history, and I believe that the author of this article unwittingly proved so. For these reasons, I believe that the author of this article failed to support their thesis with thorough evidence or detail.       ",5
1758d4d,"In our society, technology is advancing significantly by the day. What was once a letter that took 10-day trip overseas to its appropriate destination is now just a simple text message that reaches a person within seconds. The automobile is an innovation that has also advanced dramatically, enough to the point where almost every person who can afford to have one does because of its necessity when transportation becomes a factor. The idea of a car becoming ""driverless"" is simply another boost in the technology available to cars today, as discussed in ""Driverless Cars are Coming."" Due to its many benefits, driverless cars are a positive additon to our society.

Driverless cars offer a multitude of benefits for any passengers that might use them for transportation. For one, the necessity to have to buy or pay off a car would essentially cease to exist. If computer-operated vehicles were capable of driving in all areas, then what would the need for having your own car be? Even if the car wasn't ""fully automated"" and the driver would have to take over at some point, the less work you have to do, the more time you have to work on something else. The article addresses this topic ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" The biggest asset that the consumer gains from a driverless car is time, while still being transported in a safe and reliable vehicle. This reinforces the advantages available to consumers who use a driverless car.

Speaking of safety, there is not a vehicle more safe than one that is more or less ""automatic."" With autmoated cars, drivers will be able to transport themselves without having to add the extra element of driving into a day that might be stressful. However, not all cars are fully capable to driving themselves yet without driver assistance. The good news? This innovation still grants a tremendous amount of safety to the driver in charge. The features previously cited as being used as tiem fillers can also be quickly changed to inform the driver that they need to take over: ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" An advantage to this approach is that if all communication and distractions from within the car is shut down, then the driver has no choice but to focus on the road, another argument for the push of driverless cars.

The last topic at hand with these types of vehicles skims along the lines of controversial. Liability is a very integral part of the car industry, accidents will always be an issue, as cited by the article: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" Would smarter cars help this problem? First off, it's important to acknowledge that accidents happen on the open road every day, with the primary cause being mistakes that drivers make. Therefore, manual vechicles are not necessairily dangerous, but are not as reliable as an automatic vehicle. Think about other practical additions that help consumers, such as a lifeguard on a beach. If they weren't there, would we be as safe? Probably not. Therefore, if the addition of driverless cars ensures that a safer option is available, then it only makes sense that the advantage should be taken.

In conclusion, driverless cars have brought about many new benefits in our society. From their ease of access to consumers to the top level of safety features that are sure to be made available in them, they will clearly become the top option of vehicle to use in our society once enough of them are made. This technological innovation is capable of doing many wonders in the automotive industry.",5
178f445,"In the 21st century there has

been a lot of new technology invented. Driverless cars is among the many invention ideas that is still on the drawing board. Driverless cars should not be developed because it will cost a lot of money, traffic laws will have to be modified, and the cars won't be truely driverless.

The amount of money it will cost to make a mass oroduction of driverless cars is not worth it. The passage says ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sennsors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" All of the items that the Toyota Prius has on it will be needed for the new driverless cars. The things mentioned in the quote do not include the many internal modifications that will need to be made. The car companies that create cars will need to pay to have thier workers trained to be able to do the modificatins that the driverless car needs. The car company will also have to pay for all of the expensive sensors that are needed. This wil drive up the over all cost of the smart car, and make it too expensive for the average working person.

The driving laws that exist as of today focus on keeping all citizens safe, and lawmakers assume that the onlt safe cars have an alert human driver. The passage says ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safecar has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" In the US the laws state that it is illegal in many states . The laws in those states would have to be changed to allow driverless cars to enter into that state. The traffic laws that those states have were created to try and keep all members of society safe. The assumption of the states with these laws are that the only safe car is a car being driven by an alert human. Sincethis is that case the laws that were created most likely would not be changed to allow driverless cars to drive on the roads of those states.

The cars would not be able to be completly driverless. The passage says ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The cars that have been invented and tested so far are unable to be completly driverless. The cars lack skills that only humans are able to accomplish. These skills include navigating through work zones and accidents, which are two very common things on today's roads.

Since the cars are not completly driverless a human driver will have to be alert at all times in case the car isn't able to preform a human driving skill that is needed.

The overall cost, law changes, and driving assistance that will be needed to operate a driverless car is not worth it. Those factors will not change in a few years, so car companies should not waste their time and resources trying to develop a driverless vehical.    ",5
18865e7,"The students of today are the leaders of tomorrow. This statement directly portrays that students have the potential to grow and do outstanding things. In order for this growth, a student must be well educated in his or her school teachings, and must be confident in his or her learning. The Facial Action Coding System is a new technological device that can read a person's facial expression. Using this innovative technology, a teacher can thoroughly recognize if a student is understanding the material, and is confident in their studies. The use of this face-reading technology for students is essential towards a student's overall education, as well as personal confidence.

Education in the classroom is very valuable towards a student's growth. Due to personal experience, a student does not only need the education itself, but needs to understand the education for more knowledge. This facial-reading computer can clarify if a student is actually understanding the education. For example, Dr. Huang stated, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Therefore, if a student is struggling, ""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Therfore, this directly shows that the technology created can increase a student's performance in school. This can allow the teacher, or the program, to help the student understand more information when a student is struggling. This innovative technology can result in positive changes in student's education and school environments.

A student must be confident in what he or she is learning to advance in school. Without confidence, a student is often lost and loses hope in their personal ability. With confidence, a student is proud and is ready for any assignment given to them. This new innovative technology, the Facial Action Coding System, can determine whether a student is confident in their studies. As Dr. Huang stated, the technology studies facial expressions and muscles to determine what expression is being conveyed. Using this technology can allow the teacher, or the program, to determine if you are happy, proud, and understanding the material, or if you are angry, distraught, and unhappy with the material. This allows the teacher to provide personal help, so that therefore, they can provide understanding and you are more confident, and ready for subsequent information. This technology can help provide confidence for students in their respective studies.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in school environments would prove to be very beneficial and valuable. Through the ability of this new technology, understanding the education would greatly increase among students who need extra study tools and material. Confidence could be measued through the technology and help could be provided, so that students are better prepared mentally and physically for future assignments. This innovation could be used to guide the students of today, into leaders of tomorrow",5
190ca77,"Have you ever heard of the Face on Mars? Do you believe in life on Mars? The Face on Mars was first discovered in 1976, but gained a gargantuan amount of attention in 2001 (paragraph 1). Conspiracy theorists belive that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, however this theory is false (paragraph 5). The Face on Mars is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa (paragraph 12). This can be proven by understanding that Martian mesas are common (paragraph 2); realizing that in the 2001 photo if something was near the Face, NASA would have been able to see it

(paragraph 11); and acknowledging the fact that the Face on Mars resembles natural structures on Earth (paragraph 12).

First, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because Martian mesas are common. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh,"" (paragraph 2). The fact that Martian mesas are common makes the idea of the face on Mars being a natural martian Mesa more logical. This is because there are more natural landforms called Martian Mesas on Mars than just the Face.

In addition, the Face on Mars in a natural landform because in the 2001 NASA photo, if there was Martian life people would have been able to see it (paragraph 11). ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" (paragraph 11). ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" (paragraph 11). This means that no matter what was near the Face on Mars during the photo, people would have been able to see what it was.

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" (paragraph 12). The Face on Mars is quite similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (paragraph 12). The fact the Face on Mars is resemblant to natural landforms on Earth makes it more understandable that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. This is because this lets people know that these types of natural landforms are possible, and that they are even common.

Conspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars , and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mars (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered a mesa which are very common on Mars (paragraph 3).Therefore these peoples' theories are not true.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is definitely a natural landform. This is because it is considered a Martian mesa which are common around Cydonia (2). Also, the Face on Mars can be justified as a natural landform because if their was any Martian life located near the Face on Mars during the 2001 NASA photo, people would have been able to see it and tell what it was. Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth.  ",5

Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money. Once a week you could to this to stop in increes of smog in our enviorment and even help with traffic jams. And without traffic jams eveyone is less stressed out and a lot more happier.

191623d,"Dear, State Senator

I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people.? They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for him/her.? I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair.? The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president.? If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the orignal electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him.? The peoples vote would'nt matter.? This situation happened in the two-thousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more indivisual votes than electoral votes.? This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it.? If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states.? In the electoral system, each state has a winner-take-all system.? When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him.? This can cause mayhem, the non-counted votes can make a big diffrence in the election.? In nineteen-seventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side.? The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates.? The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote.? Each elector equals each member in your states House Of Represenatives and add two for the senate.? California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000.? Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55.? This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors.? The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true .

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government.? The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens.? This situation has'nt happened since eightteen-eighty eight, its a rare occurance.? Electoral votes also make the playing field even.? If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states.? The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced.? Even so they even out the playing field and the occurence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eightteen-eighty eight and two thousand.? If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.       ?    ",5

The first reason all guys should become a seagoing cowboy, it involves getting to help others in need. After a long, devasting war, many countries have just been left in ruins to rot. The people there need hope. A seagoing cowboy can get these countries on their feet again and help the countries recover by giving the people that live in them food, animals, and more. Lets face it, we are those people's only hope, They are dieing out there. The only solution is to become a seagoing cowboy and save them.

The second reason all guys should become a seagoing cowboy, it involves getting to have fun while hanging out with other guys. On the ship while the cowboys are going to other countries to help other people, they get to have boatloads of fun. The cowboys often play baseball and volleyball games when they hang out with eachother. Not to mention the table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and reading. The cowboys are never bored and are always finding something fun to do. Clearly, being a seagoing cowboy is a very fun and relaxing job.

The final reason all guys should become a seagoing cowboy, they get to explore the world and see amazing places. The cowboys get to see Europe and China daily. They also get to explore all of the amazing place there like the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, castles in Crete, and the Panama Canal. Anyone who wants to see the the amazing world should definitley sign up to be a seagoing cowboy. This really is the oppurtunity of a lifetime for everyone who is dieing to get out of the house.

Some people may love home but really want to go on this trip. They also may not want to leave their beautiful family behind all by themselves. It might be possible that they are just scared to travel to an unknown place, but, being a seagoing cowboy allows the cowboys to only take one trip to help others, have fun, and see the world. It won't take very long at all!

Being a seagoing cowboy is an amazing job to take. The cowboys get to help other countries, have fun, and see the world and all of its beauties. Everyone who has ever become a cowboy has had the time of there life. Wait, have all the people who were reading this story stop to sign up?   ",5

The human kind as a whole isn't always the keenest when it comes to being aware of our surroundings, and being able to have a car that allows us to pay more attention without actually doing anything could take away a lot of the pressure for drivers, especially teen drivers.

Fuel consumption has always been, and probably always will be one of the top issues associated with cars and driving. But with the creation of these new, driverless cars, the amount of fuel consumption should go down according to Google cofounder, Sergey Brin. The health of our planet is a major concern, and having millions, maybe even billions, of cars letting out gas is not making it better. If we can create a car that requires less fuel (which means it'll produce less gas into the air), then that is one thing we can check off of the list of things destroying Earth.

Sensors and lasers are also great contributions to the completion of driverless cars. Although they would, of course, still require the driver to be on stand-by, 98% of the energy to opererate and drive the car would be done by the car itself. Technogly is continuously advancing, and at an even faster pace, it's getting hard to keep up. In no time we'll all be driving in cars that don't actually require us to drive. Sebastian Thrun seems to have the same idea, considering that in just the time frame of the 2000s, we've created GPS, computers, laptops, and touchscreen cellphones.

Paragraph eight asks us ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" I think these are great questions! I know that as a new driver, I would totally miss not being able to drive, so why not create a car that gives you the option of deciding if you want the car to drive itself, or if you want to drive! Of course no one likes traffic, and who likes 16+ hour car rides to Florida? These could be the times that the car would drive by itself.

All in all, driverless cars could be one of the many successes of man kind, but safety is still an issue. It's a great thing to be able to come up with the idea to create things such as driverless cars, but it's even better to know your'e the one who perfected the idea, and turned it into a reality. We are living in a reality of an innovative generation that's only just getting started. I can't wait to see what happens next. Maybe my car will be flying by then, too!",5
1a229bc,"I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical. And, to prove my point, I have conjured a few reasons as to why this ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

Firstly, the picture taken in 2001 is solid proof, as well as the 1998 picture. Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.

Also, I will point out that, in 1976, we at NASA were still relatively new to venturing beyond Earth's orbit. The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was.

My final claim that the Face on Mars is a mesa lies in the fact that, if the Face really was an alien monument, NASA would not keep their lips tight about it. It would make global headlines, and shock the world. I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed ""aliens"" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.

Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens. Thank you for your time and effort in reading this essay.",5
1ac3740,"Exploring Venus would be a pretty amazing experience and to find out everything that is on that planet would be pretty awesome as well. With exploring this planet it does bring many dangers and challenges. Venus is nothing like Earth on the safety scale for humans, so sending humans to Venus is a very hard tasks to do. Even though there are many dangers to trying to explore Venus there are also a lot of benefits like finding out what lived or lives on the planet. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" greatly supports the idea of how Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it has many dangers.

In this article the author describes very well what all the dangers of exploring Venus are. There are many different dangers or challenges to doing this. For example the author of this article stated that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This quote is showing just two examples of how unsafe Venus is. It is saying that the air is filled almost fully with carbon dioxide which is deadly to humans and the clouds are full of acid that could kill humans as well. The author also describes in the article how dangerously hot the surface of Venus is and it could simply kill someone. The author does very well at describing the dangers of exploring Venus. They give many examples as to why it is almost impossible to explore there.

The author then gives examples as to why it would be a worthy pursuit to be able to explore there. Even though the amount of dangers are huge there are many good reasons as to try and be able to explore Venus. In this passage it is said that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This quote is showing that if they were to get someone to be able to explore Venus then we would be able to find information about the planet like this out. It would be even better if they were able to get up and personal to the planet like collect rocks, gas, or other things on the planets surface as explained in the article. It would be one great experience to find out what life on other planets would be like.

All of this imformation is showing how well the author is convaying the message of how worthy it would be to be able to explore Venus even though it has many dangers. The author is giving the readers many different examples of what the dangers are, why it would be important to explore this planet, and also how they are trying to figure out ways to do so. The author explained how NASA is trying to find many different approaches to be able to explore Venus and get information. All of this information that was explained in this article are great ways to showing how it is a worthy pursuit to exploring Venus. It makes the readers of the article get a clear picture of everything and why it would be good to try to explore this planet.

Yes, exploring Venus would be really great and it brings many dangers. As read in this article the author does a great job as to showing the readers why it would be a worthy pursuit even though it brings many dangers with it. The author included many details about what the dangers are, why it would be important to explore Venus, as well as how NASA is trying to solve this issue. ",5
1af5f9b,"For decades humans have been fascinated by the idea of cars that do not require any human assisstance to drive. In recent years, this Science- Fiction movie staple has become les of a dream and more of a reality. Many companies are producing and testing drivelerless cars, but are they really safe? Driverless cars are unsafe because they require human attention, and because technology is unreliable. They are also impractical, and therefore, will never become a household staple.

The term ""driverless""

is not really the best word to describe these cars, because they do require an alert human driver, with their eyes on the road, and may even require the human driver to take over in certain situations, such as backing out of a driveway, or thorugh a contruction zone. This begs the question,"" What is the point?"" Why would we go through the trouble of creating these self-driving cars, if they are not completely self- driving? The truth is that no technology can replace human insticts in situations such as road-construction or traffic jams. However, if people are able to drive these cars, many wil most likely not pay attention to their surroundings. To solve this issue, many companies have invented creative ways to get the driver's attention when they need to take over. However, the only way for these cars to be completely safe is for the driver to remain alert and watching the road at all times. If a driver is already watching the road, they may as well just drive themselves!

In addition to this, there is the issue of whether these cars can truly be trusted. There are many issues with technology in our day to day lives. If a person's TV or cell phone stops working while they are using it, it is not a disasterous issue, but if their car stops accelerating and steering in the middle of the road, there may be monumental consequences! Technology can never be relied on completely, because there will always be issues and problems that may arise. Simply put, there is a reason that these cars are outlawed in almost every state!

Safety issues aside, there is also a practicality issue with these cars. Is this really something that people will use in their everyday lives? Will these cars be a practical item for common people? As discussed earlier, the driver has to keep constant attention on the road for these cars to be safe. These cars simply are not practical. For example, the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assisstant"" can only reach speeds of 25 miles per hour, and requires the driver to keep hold of the wheel. These cars also use a lot of sensors. Would they be practical and effecient to manufacture? Chances are, many people would not even be able to afford these vehicles, becuase the prices would be astonomical. These cars are not practical for everyday use by the average person. They are more fitting as a toy for a celebrity or millionaire. The self-driving car will not become a household staple for the everyday family.

Self-driving cars shoud not continue to be developed. These vehicles are unsafe and impractical. They require constant human attention and the liability issues are muddy, at best. For these reasons, self-driving cars should not continue to be developed, and will never become a common item in the United States.    ",5
1b14997,"In this reading, the author is talking about exploring venus, but all his evidence speaks differently. I believe the author does not support the clam that Venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre. He contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over, and has not given any reason why we should go over there.

In this short persuasive article, the author does not pursuade at all. In paragraph two, the backround of Venus is given, but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement gives no reason for traveling and researching Venus except for the fact it used to be like Earth.

Though it is said Earth is one of a kind, this article states Venus is the most like Earth planet they've ever found. That could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting, but it is proven with evidence that Venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting. In paragraph three, it is said, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four. It is also said, ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify."" This evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on, except in the fifth paragraph, it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus. This is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere, and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans, and even metal.

In conclusion, the evidence the author has given us condradicts and outweighs the evidence given for the idea Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, meaning he did not support this idea. ",5
1b1975b,"Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.

Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.

Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.

Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...""Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

1b26302,"Dear state senator,

There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this arguement, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electors than California). It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term. And i speak for most of the people in the U.S. when i say, as Bob Dole did: Abolish the electoral college!    ",5
1bd5edc,"The Natural Landform on the Unatural Planet

Seeing something that you can't really tell what it is is frustrating, right? NASA and conspiracy theorists totally know what you are going through. NASA found a

""Face on Mars"" and now everyone thinks it has something to do with aliens. Well, they are very wrong. NASA would have benefitted from the ""Face of Mars"" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998 snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless summer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics may have their points on to why it may be created by aliens, but NASA has three amazing photos to prove them wrong. The Face on Mars is not really a face after all.

To begin, NASA's budget would have benefitted a lot if the landform had anything to do with aliens at all, so why would they want to keep it a secret if it were true? First things first, When NASA revealed the photo of the huge landformation it became a huge hit! They were hoping to catch the attention of Mars to the public, and boy oh boy, they did just that. It starred in a Hollywood movie, appeared in magazines, books, radio talkshows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Unfortunately, the positive popularity always comes with the negative. Some conspiracy theorists thought that the Face was bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA's budget can only wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

Secondly, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, the section on Mars where ""The Face"" lives, snapped a picture of it ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture proves again that the face is just a landform. The conspiracy theorists and people that supported their opinion were still not happy with the results. They said in paragraph 8, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" I don't know how they get these crazy assumptions, but they will just never give up! They went all the way back to take a second picture to prove they're wrong, don't you think that shows that nothing about this landform is alien infested, or was created by them?

Last, but not least, They took a second picture of ""The Face"" at the highest resolution possible to prove to the opposing side again. ?We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,? said Garvin. ?Malin?s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera?s absolute maximum resolution.? Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin proved the correct point for everyone, hopefully having everyone believing that ""The Face"" is not a face, just a lava dome.

On the other hand, the other side had a bit of detail to help support their side as well. Their first assumption was that in the second photo, wispy clouds covered any alien like markings. To prove that wrong NASA took another photo at the highest resolution to prove that it is just a natural landform on Mars that has nothing to do with aliens. The skeptics will probably never give up on how this was made by aliens, but NASA has three extraordinary photos to prove them wrong every single time.

In conclusion, ""The Face"" is just a natural landform. NASA would have benefitted from the ""Face of Mars"" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998 snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless summer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics can try to find every way to show that aliens had something to do with it, but they don't have three pictures of the landform itself. Real facts beat assumptions every time. Mars may be a mysterious place, but what isn't mysterious is the natural landform on Cydonia. ",5
1bfcf1f,"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.

The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.

Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.

The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.

In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",5
1c139c1,"In the United States of America, and all over the world, cars are used every day. People use them to get to work, to go see family, and to get simply, from A to B, but a new idea is sprouting up in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere where people are doing something unheard of.... giving up their cars. According to Source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"",? Vauban, Germany is a city that is almost completely car free. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" THis shws that living without cars is not only possible, but could have some great consequences.

Living car free could seem like something impossible, but it has great effects. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a study ervealing that passenger cars are responsible for 12 peercent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe....and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Without cars, we could lower pollution, which is a huge problem for some places. In the second article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris has to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city after days of near-record pollution. Motorist with even number liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars on day and motorists with odd numbered plates were ordered to the next day. This enforcement had positive consequences along with it. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital and the smog hanging over the city eventually cleared. This shows almost immediate benefits to the decline in driving. Can you imagine the benefits after a long term period of car-free cities? The possibillities are limitless.

Car-free periods of time don't have to be long term. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day takes place every year and it is a ""big hit"" with millions of Colombians according to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". For the third straight year, cars have been banned only excluding busses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog in the city of 7 million. Anyone who violated the rules were fined 25 dollars. For the first time ever, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined in the event. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This should show that car free periods of time are possible, not matter how long, and that they have great consequences that come along with them.

You might say that it would be extremely difficult to make America a car free country. Well, according to a report in the fourth article ""The End of Car Culture"" America may be on it's way. Research studues show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The nummber of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to a analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Thsi shows that there is a steady decline in driving and autiomotive transport in America. Also found in the fourth article, if the pattern persists, it will have beneficial impliactions for carbon emmisions and the enviorment. Many sociologists believe the pattern will continue. Alternate sources of transportation have popped up also. In New York, a new bike sharing program has popped up and in San Fransisco, Bay Arear Rapid Transit is another viable option of transport. With all of these options, doesn't one fit you?

In conclusion, alternate transport oppurtunities and car free periods of time are the solution. With so many ways to lower how much and how you drive. The switch to a more economic means of transport would be easier than you think. The possibillities are endless and multiple studies show that the good consequences outweigh the bad ones. One question is yet to be asked, are you ready to make the switch to the better way of tansport?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ????

1c1c470,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is valuable. I believe this technology would be great to use in a classroom. It would really help the teacher with his or her lesson. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If a simple classroom computer can determine a students' emotions, that would be a great assistance to a teacher. The teacher would then know if he should go into greater detail or if he should make his lesson plan a little more interesting.

Human Beings can be really good at hiding their emotions. With the Facial Action Coding System no one would be able to hide their true emotions. If someone was really depressed, but they portray themselves to be happy, this technology could stop that person from hurting themselves or others. If a school therapist or school social worker had this technology it would make their jobs so much easier. They could sense what the students are really feeling, rather than what the students want them to think their feeling. Also, the school therapist would know if the patient would need to be prescribed any medicine.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea is because, as stated in the article, it could reveal so much about the science of emotions. The FACS (Factial Action Coding System) could detect a false smile. If you are not feeling geniunely happy, if you are just ""putting on a happy face"" this technolgy would be able to see through what your false act. This new technology could become the next big thing. It would be able to uncover the truth about alot of people.

The last argument I am going to state on why the FACS would be valuable on detecting students emotions is that the technology could tell whether a student is telling the truth or not. The article states in paragraph 8 that usually when someone squint their eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of their eyes usually means that their not being thruthful. FACS uses muscle clues to determine whether a person if being truthful or not. This would be great in a classroom. For example, if someone is being bullied and they tell the teacher but the bully says he isn't bullying anyone, this would be great for the teacher. The teacher would know which one of her students is telling the truth.

In Conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a superb idea. This new technology would not only be very interesting but it would also save many lives. This technology could be used in many different jobs. It could also help many people. With this technology you would no longer have to take someones word on how their feeling, even when you have a gut feeling telling you otherwise. Rather than assuming what someone is feeling you could now know for sure with the Facial Action Coding System. ",5
1c745e9,"FREEDOM!

We are all americans here so we should have the freedom we were ment to have. I understand that we do in fact have a lot more freedom than other countries but I am talking more on voting freedom. The electoral college is, in my opinion and many others, a bad way to decide the president of the United States of America. I beleive that for americans we should have a better say in things and agree that we rather have popular voting than what we have now. Others beleive the electoral college helps with Big States issues. But in the end popular vote is a good way to help people who deserver presidency to get it.

The article The Indefensible Electoral College, many have agreed on abolishing the electoral colleg. The article (The Indefensible Electoral College...) states ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to what we are doing now."" If we the people do not get final say into things than we are'nt really as free as we are told we are. If the people want a different voting system it should be granted to us. A good example to people who had been effected by this was Al Gore. The articel states. ""Al Gore who had won by popular vote but still lost the presidency to the electoral college."" This goes to show that he was someone that many wanted as a president but where cheated out by the electoral college.

Others may believe that the electoral college helps not let bigger and more populated states get more attention than a smaller state would. But even by popular vote this would be the same. If a populated state votes then they will get basically the same say as they would with the electoral college but it would give them more say. Whilst other low population states get less votes and attention just like with the electoral college. So even though it would make a great change with other things, this matter is no problem.

Few have lost presidency due to the quirks in the electoral college. A good example is Al Gore who I talked about earlier. But still in the future changing to popular vote will help people who earned presidency actually get it. Instead of being scammed out of their votes by the electoral college. If someone has earned the presidencty then they should have the right to it, but with the electoral college in the way some are unable to actually do this. If we the people want someone to be the president than we want them! Al Gore won popular vote but since we do not get the only say he had lost presidency. If popular demand was the only voting system than we would probably be in a better place right now.

In conclusion, we the people of the united states deserve to actually have our own and only say in to who is going to lead us. If we say we want them, we want them... I understand that we our the ones that get the say, but we are being evened out by state percentage, so basically popular voting is ruled out. Popular voting is a better way to vote mainly because it is straight forward and to the point. If someone receives more individual votes than they should be the president... It is a easy straight forward process...       ??       ?    ?       ?       ???    ",5
1c8d415,"In the article ：Driverless Cars Are Coming,： the author talkes about positive and negative aspects of having diverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous for they can only operate correctly in the right condicions. These smart cars could be putting peoples lives at risk and cause serious problems, and the only way these problems could be truly solved is with a great abundence of money. Aruguments would accure about whos fault it would be if someone were to get into an accident. Driverless Cars need to be highly improved or not put onto the roads, you should always be more safe than sorry.

Therefore, in this article it says, ： all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and aroung accidents：(7). Showing how dangerous these smart cars can really be. If the car can not work properly in the condicions that are all around us, what makes them safe to have on the roads? As the cars keep devoloping the more dangerous they will become to us humans, if smart cars ever get to the point where they truly are driverless it would not be neraly as safe to be out on the roads. This is because these cars are know to have problem with changes in the road and when they notice this change they are programed to alert the human driver. Thinking of that, what if a child were to run out onto the road, how fast can this car really react, or how fast could this smart care alert the human driver? These driverless cars should be concidered hilgly dangerous to humans for they will never have the power to oberate just as a human could.

To futher explain why these cars could only hurt not help human kind, ：Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads：(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe.

Overall these cars would also be very hard to get llegalised. ：Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers：(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help.

To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry. Make the right choice and do whats right to keep people safe, not to make their lives easier. ",5
1cc3ce2,"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any run-off elections. Run-off elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that? the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The resonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",5
1cfab57,"Dear State Senator,

It has recently come to my attetnion as I study our states voting system, that we as Americans do not have enough word in who we have as our leader. In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our Consitution it states all men are creted equal, when in all relaity we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do. Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it alllows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. It also gives less say to the smaller states making the people there feel there vote doesnt count, allowing them to vote for any party. If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president.

The first reason i feel we should overthrow the Electoral College is becasue it is discriminating states votes based on there sizes.? In the article,""Does the Electoral College Work"", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.

Another reason i feel we should favor the popular vothing system is because this would show that the soon to be presidents should vist all of there voters rather then the ones they know they will probably win. ""Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" What the author is saying here is the canidates dont give equal chances to the states to here what they,the canidates, have to say. For example if a democrate is going to states he would most likley avoid the ones full of republicans because he feels he has no chance and does not spend the money. But, if we get majority votes this will allow every indvividual to vote rather a group of republicans. Not only does this allow a better chance of winning for that democrate it allows the voters to feel like they can change there minds because they have a say. This will contribute to the conidates because they can now get there point across to more, rather then to select little groups.

The final reason we should get rid of this system is because at this point in time we are not even vothing for our presidents we are voting for people who vote for us. What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.

As we learn more about this topic we realize how rediculious this situation is. Obviously, going with popular vote is the best solution because we will finally be what everyone has been trying to do for decades, be equal. Sir, i hope you understand my ?rgument and really take into concideration what i have said. Our presidents make decisions for us everyday, dont you think its time me get to make one for ourselves?

Sincerly,

1d031f0,"Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's ""twin"" and the ""Evening Star"" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work. The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth.

Compared to Earth, the author has found that Venus in less less survivable for humans. In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth. The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the ""most Earth-like [planets]"" as it ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (Paragraph 4). Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability.

Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful, but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms. The author is better able to address the disadvantages of studying Venus because of the extensive research revealing the planet's present volatile state instead of benefits from its similarity to Earth. Therefore, the author fails to thoroughly prove Venus' worthiness of exploration.",5
1d0a8db,"The planet of Venus is considered to be a danger to humans given the conditions it is in. In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that depsite the dangers presented by Venus, it would be a worthy pursuit to study the planet. The author helpfully establishes multiple key pieces of evidence supporting this claim such as Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit, and trying to get to Venus is considered a challenge that could help humans prepare for even more extremely challenging environments.

In paragraph two, the author states ""Often refered to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too."" This quote, along with this quote, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" showcase exactly how alike Venus may have been to Earth. This could be helpful in studying the possibilities of what may eventually happen to planet Earth.

Not many planets are as close to Earth as Venus is and that is a crucial point when the amount of time space travel can take is taken into consideration. Humans have accomplished and gained much knowledge about space travel since the race to space began. Scientists' have meticulously studied everything they could learn about space and can even estimate how much time it would take to travel to different places in space. This is crucial when you take into consideration how much time, effort, and money goes into space travel. With Venus being so close to the Earth, and all those factors taken into consideration, it seems to be an obvious and intelligent choice to make that humans should not give up on travelling and studying Venus. More than anything, it would be a wasted opportunity.

While the idea of being able to study Venus seems daunting, perhaps it is only the lack of courage that is holding NASA back from doing it. Curiosity is a natural thing that all humans are born with, and it never goes away. This is relevant because with curiosity, the gain of knowledge can go hand in hand with it. Without curiosity, not even half of the things humans have done and developed would be possible. Shying away from Venus is doing more harm than good, and it will only serve to produce hesitancy at the sight of any challege.

The author of the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" brings up many key points of evidence as to why Venus should be explored and studied, despite the dangers of it. Among those are, it is the closest planet to Earth relatively speaking, Venus is the closest distance, and the study of the planet Venus brings up a unique challenge to the human race that backing down from would be detrimental. All of the key points supports the author's idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",5
1d106d5,"Countries and cities all across the world are joining in on the ""no car"" trend, and it seems to be no passing fad. From Germany, to France, to Columbia, to the United States, everybody is trying to start drving less for a cleaner, happier world. Countries' governments everywhere are trying to get people off the roads and start biking, walking, or using public transportation instead. As the people in these countries have learned, there are many advantages to giving up drving cars, if even only for a few days rather than their entire lives.

The main advantage is a cleaner planet. Emissions that cars release play a large role in the world's air pollution. Carbon emissions create smog that makes the sky grey, damages our lungs, and harms the plants that give us clean air. Due to carbon emissions from cars, Paris once had as much smog as ""Beijjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (Source 2). If we start driving less cars it will have really beneficial implications for the environment, especially ""... since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Source 4). Imagine what positive effects banning cars would have on the population's and world's health.

One positive effect would be a lot less stress. Driving is a dangerous activity where you are constantly putting yourself at risk. Many people realize this and tend to be scared of driving or are constantly nervous when they drive. Rushing to drive to work on time also creates negative stress. Says German media trainer and mother, Heidrun Walter, of no longer owning a car, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Daily long commutes are also a large determining factor in someone's mood. Some people have to drive for hours a day just to get to their already stressful job and then again when they go back home. This creates for a very unhappy society. Now there are a couple of good things that come from a society that is no longer obsessed with car culture. One thing is that ""the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends"" (Source 4). This lessens the need have a car to take you to distant places. With the banning or lessening use of personal vehicles cities and towns are being rebuilt. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This has encouraged healthier and cheaper modes of transportation such as walking, skating, bicycling, and public transportation such as buses.

Fewer cars and this rebuilding of cities saves you money and commute time. Just think about all those rising gas prices. You don't need to pay tolls when you walk, or get fined when you run too fast. Prices for parking spots and passing tolls are going up anyway. It's an easier and cheaper alternative to just walk or bike somewhere. Public transportation like buses and subways cost a lot less too. Studies have found that fewer people are buying cars and getting their licenses; it's for a reason.

Lastly, not only are leaders across the globe joining in on the idea of life without cars, but so are car-selling companies. ""Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themeselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" (Source 4). Even Bill Ford, executive chariman of the Ford Motor Company proposed a business plan in which ""personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable."" Ford suggested becoming partners with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" (Source 4).

So next time you think about buying a new car or driving to work all buy yourself, try to rethink your actions and imagine the effect it will have on not only you, but everyone around you. Maybe you can bike to work if it's not that far, take the bus instead, carpool with some coworkers. The planet and future generations will thank you if you just limit your car usage, even a little bit at a time.       ?    ",5
1d80630,"Driverless cars: are they really safe? There are many points to go with the postitive and negative things about driverless cars. Both sides have very important points to make. There are, however, many more negatives than positives. Three negative points that will be discussed in this essay are: driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions and put many people in danger, and there is an increased risk of car crashes if driverless cars are used.

To begin, driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers. If a driverless car were to fail to do a task correctly, that mistake could result in an accident. This accident would then bring up the question, ""who is at fault?"" When this question surfaces, many drivers will blame the car manufacturing company, bringing up the point that the car itself failed and not the driver. When this point is brought up, many car manufacturing companies will have to fight lawsuits and have to appear in court. This court showing would result in a large conflict for the company and for the driver, seeing as many people outside of the issue would take sides. The issue would become a large problem for the world, and would be easily settled if driverless cars were not mad to begin with.

Also, driverless cars would increase the amount of car malfunctions that could happen on the road, resulting in an increased danger when going out on the roads. Driverless cars could malfunction in many ways. For example, they could fail to alert the driver when they need to take over, they could fail to communicate that something is wrong with the car itself, or they could fail to drive correctly. Each of those malfunctions could cause serious problems on the road, and put many people in even more danger than they are already in. Although there are many more malfunctions that could happen with a driverless car, they could all be prevented if driverless cars were not let out on to the streets.

The third point is that driverless cars increase the risk of car accidents. Car accidents happen in many ways. If a driver is distracted, if a car malfunctions, if there is a road block, etc. With driverless cars, many drivers will become more distracted, feeling as though they dop not need to watch the road at all and can do whatever they please. However, that is not the case. With a driverless car, people need to be on a higher alert than they would with a regular car: making sure the car does not malfunction, and keeping an eye out for the worst. If a driver were to become too distracted, they would not be watching the road closely enough, and are putting many lives in danger. If the car were to try and get the driver's attention for assistance through an area the car felt it could not drive through, the driver would be too distracted and the car could crash.

To conclude, there are multiple negative effects driverless cars would have if they were used. Driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions, resulting in many lives put in danger, and with driverless cars there is an increased risk of car crashes. Driverless cars are a bad idea, and should not be put on the roads. They put many people in danger. Driverless cars: are they really safe?    ",5
1d8e8c7,"For many years, researchers have stared at the Mona Lisa. They have made countless observations and have even created this new technology that detects her emotions through facial recognition. Creator Prof. Thomas Huang has named this the Facial Action Coding System. This may not seem very important in the outside world, but the use of Facial Action Coding could be very beneficial in classrooms because it could understand the student's frustration and confusion and would modify the lesson to better fit the student, counselors could use it ot help determine how a student is truly feeling, and it would help teachers better understand the students who rarely talk in their class.

Facial Action Coding could be benificial in classrooms because the technology could understand the student's frustration and confusion and modify the lesson to better fit the student. In schools all around, students are starting to give up. They get too angry at their homework and decide that they don't want to work on it anymore. The problems don't change--but with the Facial Action Coding System, the problems and even the lesson itself could change and become easier for the student. This would allow for the student to wrap their mind around the concept that was given to them. In the article, Dr. Huang states in paragraph 6, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when astudent is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote tells its readers that that is what Dr. Huang wants this new technology to do. Teachers have to follow a guideline and a lesson plan; they have to be on track as to what the students are learning. Dealing with almost fifteen to twenty students a class, the teacher cannot physically help a student one-on-one all of the time. The Facial Action Coding System, however, would be able to. Making it more simple and more efficient for both the students and teachers. Counselors could also use this technology.

Counselors could use the Facial Action Coding System to determine how a student is truly feeling. When sitting in a counselors office, students may be tense or very nervous. Whatever they're in there for, the counselor will have to help that student. With the techonology, counselors could take one look at their face and find out what's bothering them if they are not completely open about it. The counselor would be able to find out if they're sad, upset, scared, or just pulling their strings to get out of class. A counselor's job is to make sure that the students on campus are mentally in check and are ready for the next school year with their classes and progress. When a student enters their office, the technology could sensor the student, making the counselor's job easier and time efficient. When the counselor is done with the student, they're sent back to class. The system could help students and teachers there as well.

The Facial Action Coding System may be useful to help teachers understand the students who rarely talk in class or are deaf. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang makes a wonderful point--""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" In class, students will nod their heads when they agree or understand something that their teacher is presenting them with. But what if they don't nod? Facial Action Coding could help the teacher understand that they're going to fast or that the student is lost. The teacher would then be able to assist in further explaining the lesson or even trying to make the lesson more fun and exciting. There are some students who would rather sit in their desks, avoid being wrong, and won't ask questions because they're too shy. This system would give the oppourtunity for students that were never given the chance.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System could be very useful in classrooms due to being able to modify and better fit the student based on their emotions, counselors being able to use it, and as well as letting teachers better understand students who are either deaf or rarely talk. Facial Action Coding may only progress, and progressing it shall.",5
1da8f12,"Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, -like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling- has started to become obsolete.

As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistant, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed; like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives suseptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.

says a member of the car-free community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager (ages 16-20) resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.

Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millenia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by three-quarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.

In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly ""Car-free day"" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.

Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millenials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.    ",5
1e1b741,"Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. To support my reasonings would include what Google cofounder Sergey Brin has developed and thought about. The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. Secondly would be that of the Toyota Prius that uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel which would allow you to estimate how far away or close you are to a curb or another vehicle. Lastly would be the safety that the car would be capable of.

The first reason behind my opinion is that it would be less cost effective in the long run which means that over time, you will get your money back from the car. The manufacturers have thought of a way to allow the car to drive and think for itself and allowing the driver to relax until they get notified that they should take control. Cars that are smarter will allow you to save more money and cost less mechanically, as well as save on fuel.

Secondly, would be sensors and displays in the car that allow you to focus on the task at hand when you are driving. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver said, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings.

Lastly would be that of safety. Safety is a number one priority in cars and in life as a whole. If your car is safer to drive on the highway, it will reduce the cause of accidents and save you and others around you money. That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety.

The reasons stated above show how and why that driverless cars are a must for everyday life as we know it. They save you money by not having to pay so much for gas everytime you have to fill up. The car is being driver by the hardware that is inside of it and it will notifiy if you need to take over and steer. The last reason is safety. If the car is not safe, it should not be on the road. Driverless cars are allowing the driver to pay closer attention to the road as well as what is happening around him better than if he had all the lights in his face and his phone placed in the cup holder or in his lap. The driverless car is being developing to become something greater and more useful for everyday human life. This shows how and why driverless cars are a must for everyday life and why I agree with the developement and manufacturing of these cars. ",5
1eccede,"Throughout time, pollution has been known to be a huge environmental problem. The excessive amount of individual car owners driving down streets is in no way helping this issue. Efforts to diminish the number of cars we see on our roads have been taking place in order to help the environment and therefore citizens as well.

It is no news that passenger cars are harmful to the environment. They release gases that pollute the air we breathe affecting not only us but the environment as a whole. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States (Source 1). This realization has led to the promotion of ""car-reduced"" communites by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (Source 1). But the problem is more widespread than that. Paris has acknowledged the importance of this issue after witnessing smog that rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world (Source 2). Paris's solution was to enforce a driving ban in order to help clear its air. Due to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent shortly after the intensifying smog (Source 2). It is a known fact that transportation is America's second largest source of emissions, therefore, limiting passenger car usage can greatly benefit the environment as well as citizens' everyday lives.

Limiting car usage has not only proven to be helpful towards the environment but towards citizens as well. With a decrease in car usage comes new benefits not just to individual citizens but to communities. Less cars means less time in irritating traffic. Usually, car traffic and traffic jams leads to huge amounts of stress. This is because the idea of not getting to work is stressful; not getting to work means losing money. Losing money adds even more stress. But when limiting car usage, losing money is not an issue one has to think about. Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees by stating that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Source 3). Rush-hour restrictions and other efforts towards limiting car usage have cut traffic making it easier for citizens to get to their jobs (Source 4). Those who choose other forms of transportation that are less harmful to the environment have even less of a problem and appear to be much happier. Heldrun Walter states that when she had a car she was always tense but now she is much happier (Source 1). The evidence has proven that limiting car usage is benefical to not only the environment but to citizens' daily life as well.

Keeping a clean environment is something of major importance. If one does not take care of the environment there will seize to be a healthy environment in which to live in. Limiting car usage is a big step when it comes to keeping the environment free of pollution. Not only is it beneficial to the environment but it helps citizens live a much happier life lessening the causes of stress. Limiting car usage helps the air needed to breathe, the money coming into your pockets, and one's overall happiness.    ",5
1ef4021,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.",5
1ef816d,"The author does not effectively support his suggestion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He believes that Venus has more value than just a rocky surface that is completely inhabitable by humans right now. Although the author provides multiple details that relate to his suggestion, he provides even more details that contradict his idea.

One way the author contradicts his suggestion is by telling us about the unmanned spacecraft that have been sent to Venus. He tells us how there have been multiple spacecraft sent to Venus but none have survived for a long period of time. For example, in the text the author states, "" No spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This excerpt from the author's article completely contradicts his idea. He says that Venus is a worthy pursuit, but how is he supposed to convince readers this when at the same time he is saying that no spacecraft has been sent to Venus for more than thirty years.

The author also contradicts his idea of the value of exploring Venus by describing the planet. In paragraph three the author says that Venus has ninety-seven percent caron dioxide and has clouds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He also states that Venus has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system and would liquefy many metals. These details do not help his idea at all. They just show how much more inhabitable and worthless Venus would be to explore. It would be a waste of time and money to study a planet that humans wouldn't be able to even live on.

One final way the author does not effectively support his claim is by giving us details about the challenges humans would face even if we were able to make it to Venus. He says that photography and videography would be ineffective and that researchers wouldn't be able to take samples of rock, gas, or anything else while hovering safely above the planet. So even if humans were able to make it to Venus safely, it would be extremely difficult to research Venus. It wouldn't be worth it to spend time and money on an expedition to Venus that wouldn't even allow us to gain knowledge.

The author does give a good point to why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He says that Venus was once like Earth long ago and that it was probably covered in oceans and supported various forms of life. He describes the value of returning to Venus as ""indisputable."" However, he does not give enough evidence to support this claim. He only gives one piece of evidence on why Venus is a worthy pursuit and that is that Venus is closely related to Earth. But throughout the whole article, it seems he is constantly contradicting his statement. The author could have more effectively supported his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by providing details that will outweigh his examples of the dangers and challenges that Venus presents.",5
1f0cbec,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

the author covers many points and facts about driverless cars. The author speaks about the advantages and disadvantages of the introduction of these cars. The author also speaks about the major companies making these cars from Google to Nissan. Nontheless driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, epensive, and have to many negative possibilites. These negative tradeoffs out weigh the possitive tradeoffs thus showing that introducing driverless cars would do more harm then good.

The article states ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and Pedestrians safe..."" The introduction of driverless cars would make this law harder to keep. This would be because the burden to be safe would no longer be in human hands but in the hands of a cumputer and some sensors. We have all had computers glitch or take a while to repond. It happens all the time. But then the safty of human life is in the hand of a computer it becomes somewhat disheartening. Weather conditions could also prove to be an issue with safty. Would there be a limit to how hot or how cold the environment would have to be for the sensors to work properly? With this much riding on the safty of human lives the driverless car seems to be a very unwise choice.

The answer on how expensive these cars would have to be is partly answered in paragraph six when the author states ""Radar was a device on a hilltpop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasent something you could buy at a Radio Shack."" If Radar back then was two hundred million dollars imagen how much a driverless car will be. Only the elite rich will be able to afford one and the majority of the popution will not. This shows that even if the driverless car was to come out in the near future only a handful of the population would have it since they would be the only ones who could afford it. But this also raises the issue with new roads since old ones would somewhat have to be updated in the long run. The article states that magnetic roads would be too expensive so smarter cars would be needed the roads would have to change a least a little to suit smart cars. With the many things that tax payer dollars are used for there would need to be an addition to smarter roads.

The negative possibilites of the introduction to smart cars are endless. The articel states "" in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This shows that law makers are fearful or the outcomes that some of these cars could create. Also the problem with the rise in law suit when these cars would get into an accident would also have to be put into account. The article adresses the problem of who would be to blame the driver or the maker of the car. Not only would this bring out more problems and law suits it would make it hard to find who was at fault. Also in the possiblity of an acccident if people were to be sleeping or watiching a movie responce time to move the car would be a varying constant from person to person showing that even if people were to get involved the chance to change the situation could be very slim.

WIth all of these negative situations

that driverless cars could cause it could be safe to say than the negative possibilites outweigh the positve possibilites. Driverless cars could prove to be unsafe, expensive, and have many negative possibilites. Showing that driverless are cars are not a very good idea.                ",5
1f94e33,"Thinking of the 21st century ideas of driving cars and SUV's around is considred fairly overrated now a day's. Opperating moto vehicle in city scapes and rural areas can get so overwhelming; the constant worry of oncomming traffic and pedestrians steering into your direction, dangerous pollution threatning to dystroy the ecosystems & surrounding landscapes, not to mention expenses that are strung along with the cost driving a car. By eliminating or limiting the use of cars, these unnessary issues would just simply....float away.

As we all know as a result of past generations: Global Warming is on the rise. This statement is esspecially true in the city of Paris, France...named to be the most polluted city in the world amoung tourist destinations in Europe. In a act to reduce these smog issues, ""On Monday motorist with even-numbred licence plates were ordred to leave their cars at home or suffera 22-euro fine"" says Robert Duffer who wrote from the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in the

Chicago Tribune.

Ever since Paris officals had made this change in leglisation, pollution has gone down considerabley. Imagine driving through your city (for example I live in Jacksonville Beach), and there is no more smog, traffic is reduced, and the air you breathe is actually cleaner than before. From putting certian restraints like the city of Paris did on commuting, you too could experince all the wonders of ""cut-back driving"".

Moving onto another terrific viewpoint of limited car usage is a cut down on cost. Now how great does that sound, and in this expanding economy I'll be happy if gasoline prices drop below $2 dollars! On a serious note, the price tags of a car are extreamly heavy now as they were say two decades ago. There are matanince issues, speeding tickets, parking meter tickets, if you have a flat tire then you call a tow truck which....

COST MONEY!

""New York's new bike-sharing program and it's skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal from ""The End of Car Culture"". Now in modern cities like New York, Miami, or even Jacksonville, many city officals have made this ninche of transportation much easier on civilans. Providing local trollys & public busses to help cut the cost of transportation for their residences. As exemplary from Rosenthal, its makes you happy not to drive a car as often... and makes you wallet happy too!

Although many critics are skeptical to obtain and enforce this idea, in actuallity this would be a tremendous favor to all if they participated. Sure if you don't have a car to use for example on a Saturday, then it may seem like a bummer but in perspective it's actually not! Getting around your local area and exploring all it has to offeroutside the four doors of you ""gas-hogger"" is a beautiful way to go through your day! Just think of all the cha-ching you'll be saving with every footstep you take.

1fd6b7f,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a paper that sets out to support that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After analyzing the paper, I am prepared to make the claim that the author fails to do so. He/she presents a vast array of information on the dangers of exploring Venus, as well as the challenges of doing so, but forgets almost entirely to argue that studying Venus is still is worthy pursuit. The majority of the essay focuses on setbacks, not rewards.

The author begins by explaining how spacecraft cannot survive on Venus long, and that previous missions have been short for that very reason. The pessimistic tone is continued in Paragraph 3, where the author describes the formidable heat, pressure, geology, and weather of Venus, and how such intense conditions would complicate research efforts. It states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of hihgly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In paragraphs 5 and 7, possible ways to combat these road blocks are discussed. Left out of the conversation is the ""why?"" The author describes NASA's efforts to bipass Venus's problems (like designing a hovering device or considering the use of mechanical computers) but doesn't fill readers in on why such pursuits would even be worth the effort. The question, ""We can, but why should we?"" is not answered.

To say that the author was not successful in vouching for rearch of the planet Venus is not to say that attempts were not made. Paragraphs 4 and 8 make a few attempts at telling readers why researching is still a good idea. The author informs readers that Venus is of-interest to scientists because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Mentioned also is that Venus is sometimes the closest option for planetary visitation, making its exploration a more economical choice than other planets. Paragraph 8, the conclusion, says, ""Striving to meet he challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Here the author is saying that Venus should be studied because we can gather information, and humans are curious. This is not science or fact-based, and is not strong because it is common knowledge, not argumentative material. If addressing why researching Venus is a worthy pursuit is supposedly one of the focal points of the 8-paragraph paper, evidence supporting it should be found in more than two places.

In conclusion, ""The Challlenge of Supporting Venus"" did not do a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In fact 6 out of the 8 paragraphs talk mostly about what a struggle exploration would be, and the work it would require. It focused more on giving the reader facts and figures about why studying Venus would be difficult, nearly impossible, even, but it did not thoroughly explain why such difficulties should be worked through, or why researching Venus is a fruitful and worthwhile endeavor.",5
1fdd140,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents themself really well with claims backed up by strong evidence. Venus has a lot of similarities with Earth, but hasn't been reserached enough throughout the years which needs to change in order for the future to be able to pursue their goals. The author makes a clear point in the article and supports their text with evidence to prove why society has the chance to research further into Venus and find out so much more about our neighboring planet. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because of the similarities we share among them, the close distance between us, and the history that Venus has had which could've possibly ""supported various forms of life.""

First, Venus and Earth share a lot of similarities within themselves. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Also, many years ago, there are speculations that Venus was probably full of oceans and could suport many different types of life, just as Earth was too. Many people may argue that since it was awhile ago, it can be completely different now which is true, but the author explains themself perfectly because they add that it still shares many features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Lastly, although the temperatures differ between the two planets, the author provides a great alternative to hover 30 miles above the surface of Venus. This way, people are still in contact with Venus, but remain safe with the conditions that they have put themselves in.

Furthermore, the close distance between Earth and Venus make it a lot easier for travel and research. Although that they are still far distances away, it is very close when comparing planets, and the convienence of being close provides the chance of quality research, and possibly visiting in the near future. ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in space terms--humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world."" None of the spacecrafts survived more than a few hours, but that quote should motivate and challenge the workers and future workers of NASA to hopefully get the working pieces together to form a spacecraft that can survive long amounts of time.

Lastly, since Venus once could've supported various forms of life, the possibility to be able to support life again is quite high. With the right tools and research, we as a society can make an effort and use our curiosity as motivation to fight to be able to obtain life on Venus. With the surplus amounts of valleys, mountains, and craters that it has today, humans should not fear Venus for the fact that we have these features on Earth as well. The author once again provides a great statement because providing knowledge that both planets have similarties is crucial, and may even be a reason to explore and research further into Venus.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea of studying Venus as a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents well because of how close the two planets are, the many similarities that both planets share, and also the history of Venus once supporting life. With the right research, dedication, and curiosity, the future of possibilities for studying Venus or even traveling there is endless.",5
1fe9c77,"""Eckman has classified six basic emotions！happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness！and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" Being able to associate muscle movements throughout ournface with the true current emotion someone has seems to be impossible, by the Facial Actiom Coding System can attest to that. The Facial Action Coding System could revolutionize the way classrooms are run and impact schools in a great way by altering the way classes are run based on students emotions. It would be a great idea to have this system installed as a classroom computer because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be.

Having this facial expression reading system installed in classrooms can benefit many classes with better understandings. ＾Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor [based on the students emotions].￣ Detecting how students truly feel about the lesson could be a big help in how classrooms run. For instance, if the majority of the class is sensed to be confused about the lesson, teachers are then able to see that they need to spend more time on it or reevaluate how they are teaching the lesson and slow it down. If the computer senses that the class is bored, they may not learn as well if they don't care about what they are learning so the teacher could possibly change up the class with a game. Overall it could greatly benefit classes as a whole.

This computer can help teachers and they way they run the class and teach the lesson as well. Teachers could use this technology as a baseline for themselves to see how their classes react and feel about the way they run their class. ＾A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,￣ Dr. Huang predicts. This would greatly benefit students as well because no students want to tell their teachers that they hate the way their class is run and be honest with them. This would give teachers true insite about their class and would want to make it as beneficiary to students as possible. If teachers saw that students weren't enjoying their class they could altar it in some way to make it better for everyone.

This system being installed in classrooms could also help students see what their emotions look like and possibly make them better. If students knew what their emotions looked like outside of themselves, it could be a big eye opener for them to see what they may seem to be like and that they may not know themselves. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" If students saw how their emotions looked and they weren't good they could try to change them which studies show actually could change them by just having different facial expressions. This could help all students if they were mad or sad and it detected that, they could put a smile on their face which may actually help better their emotions.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a great idea to put into classrooms that could better everyone as a whole class as well as individually. It would be an amazing idea because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be. Every teacher would run their classroom to make it as beneficial to students as possible if they could and with this installed into classrooms, it could happen. The Facial Acting Coding System would change classrooms for the better and help teachers and students expedentially.",5

That's because you are. You're sitting doing nothing bored out of your mind when you could be cruising down the road, feeling the wind in your hair, feeling completely in control. But you're not. At this point in time, driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. They are also taking away the comfort and safety that drivers today have become accustomed to.

Throughout the years, there have been many attempts and advances made toward the production of driverless cars. These attempt have not been successful thus far. The driverless cars that have been made are not even truly driverless. They still require the attention of a human. One great idea these car manufacturers had was to make smarter roads, but that is something that would take many years and a lot of money that people just don't have. In paragraph 9 of the article, it describes how there would have to be laws written and passed for this all to work out and lawmakers ""know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This shows that lawmakers are not particularly eager to make this happen and without them it won't happen.

Another reason why the project of creating driverless cars should not be continued is that it would be taking away the comfort and safety that drives today are used to. Even though drivers would not be in complete control of the cars they still ""must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires."" What is the point of having a driverless car if people are still forced to make sure the car is safe? This might even cause fear among drivers because sometimes people feel safest when they are completely control and they know others are as well, but with driverless cars they would not have that security. Sometimes it's even a comfort to people to be able to cruise down the road knowing they can take themselves anywhere they want to go. Even if they weren't afraid they would at least be bored out of their minds like everyone is on road trips. The article also describes how ""the car watches the driver."" Horror movies and tv shows all have illustrated how much people dislike feeling like they are being watched. Not to mention, there are people out there who can hack the cameras in cars and people would never really be sure that the people watching them have their best interests. In paragraph 9 the article also proposes the issue of possible conflicts arising if someone if injured in said driverless cars. Who would be at fault? This would be yet another issue courts would have to deal with when they already have so much on their plates.

Although there are many reasons why driverless cars should not be produced, there are many positive things that could possibly occur if they did exist. Sergey Brin forsees that half of the fuel used in cars today would be used for these cars and there would be more flexibility than buses, but there is no solid proof. It is very possible that instead of roads being full of buses the roads are cramped with cars and traffic would be unbearable. Also, buses typically use less fuel because they are carrying around people that would have used more fuel in seperate cars. Driverless cars have also been proven to go a million miles without crashing, but did these cars have destinations in highly populated areas with many other driverless cars around them? It's impossible to know for sure that this fact means anything without have the proper conditions accounted for. The article also says that the cars could have built in entertainment systems, but wouldn't that just distract the driver from the road? They are supposed to be ""alert and ready to take over"" at all times.

Overall, the continued research and production of driverless cars would be so much work and money used when there is already a safe system in place. Without driverless cars people won't have to worry about things changing or fear for their safety. They can just contiue to live their lives as they have for years. The article says that safety is the most important thing. If that is true, the world is better off without driverless cars.",5
2027926,"Dear Florida State senator,

I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. Inputing this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S citizens opinion on who the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.

As you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much work;much more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they comprimise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.

While reading an article about the electoral college(by Brad Plumer), I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college; And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a ""Disaster Factor"" according to paragraph 11 in the article ""The Indefinsible Electoral College"" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other people(No party, Democrats, etc.) that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.

The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The? electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.

From,

204b964,"In today's growing world to many it may seem as if living without a car would be impossible. Our ever evolving lifestyles and cultures though may prove otherwise. Across the globe it is becoming more likely for people to leave their car at home, and walk opposed to driving a short commuit. The benefits of this decision are incredibly impactful on the enviorment, improving human health and saftey, as well as on our, the people's bank accounts.? Becoming a society nonrelient on cars will prove not to be easy, but justifiable when those three points are taken into account.

The effect that cars have on the enviorment is no suprise to most. If you turn on most news channels, global warming is talked about by the hour. Thus proving drastic measures need to be taken to secure our planet's future. What better way of doing so then by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere. Source one line five states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The article goes on to state in line seven our lives being centered around the use of cars will have to change. Our planet needs it's inhabitors to treat it with the same respect people do to the dignified, and a car free world is one way to do so.

By decreasing the number of people using cars as their mode of transportation good health and safety will soon be boosted across the globe. The effect of walking instead of drving will decrease obesity and increase positive moods. According to source one line 3 Heidrun Walter believes she is much happier and less tense without a car. If she a working women and mother of two can live without a car I find many other people could find ways to also. Limiting the use of cars would not only improve health but safety. By limiting cars you limit the amount of possible accidents. Whether an accident results from carelessness, accident, or intoxication there is no arguing the fact they take many innocent lives daily. By reducing the amount of car usage this will no longer be a major factor in the premature deaths of people. According to all four sources the idea of leaving cars parked in the garage at home, or choosing to live a car free lifestyle is catching on now more than ever. Personally I hope we soon have healthier, safer pedestrians.

In today's economy money is tight. People looking to save a dollar will justify almost all reasoning to do so. Throughout the world many countries have decided to become less relient on cars. By making cities more compact people are finding it very possible to live a life without cars. Imagine cutting the price of not only a car, but car insurance and gas out of your life. I can promise you your wallet would thank you. Source four line 35 states ""We are witnessing a long term culture shift."" The internet has made it possible to connect with friends and family without meeting face to face and because of this the use of cars is rapidly declining. Source four also states many of America's youth are declining the possiblity to be licesnced and drive. Suprisingly enough Mr. Sivak, a socialogist's children do not drive; their ages being in the early twenties. This is yet more proof of our ever evolving lifestyles.

Fellow citizens, at times our lives can deal us many unexpected difficulties that make living in this day and age problematic. Cutting out the use of cars however would not be one of them. Deciding against the use of cars would impactful the enviorment, improve human health and safety, and our bank accounts from draining. All four sources prove the possiblity of a car free society throughout the entire world. So my question to you is why not stop using cars now? The world and your future self will surely thank you.

20fe8b8,"I do not beleive that the author justifies their statement of ""Venus has value"" in paragraph 8. The author does not explain the pros of exploring Venus as well as they explain the cons of why we should explore Venus. Why do I think this? Well the autor describes the deadly, hot and thick atmosphere of Venus, stating that the reason exploring Venus is worth the risk is because ""Venus still has some features that are analigous to those on Earth."" Well, does that justify spending millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on a rover or a spacecraft to explore it? I don't beleive so.

It's quite simple to explain why Venus does not need to be explored or closly examined from high up in it's atmosphere. The pros do outweigh the cons in this aticle, here is a quote from the author: ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That temperature is obviously deadly to humans, and that is a major risk when it comes to spending millions on making a rover that will only last up to a couple hours just to get a glimps on the planet. Or maybe just to get a couple pictures. The author does not go on to say how exploring Venus with genuinley benifit the human race. The author simply explains how scientists are curious about the planet and what is on it, I do not beleive that satisfying our curiosity will help anyone. This is a quote from paragraph 8 of the article that states: ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

Now, to add on to the last quote I stated from the article, the author does not state what the human race would do with that ""insight"" that we would gain about Venus, they just state that we would have insight. well then I would ask the author, what is the point in the insight if we wouldn't be able to do anything with the insight that we have gained from the exploration? All that we would gain from spending millions on sending a spacecraft to Venus would be meaningless insight and the feeding of our curiosity. When there are many bigger issues to be solved here on Earth. For example, the crisis that is curently happening in Venesuala, their government is shut down and millions are starving, some familys have resorted in digging through the trash for food and we could help them, but instead we want to spend money on gaining ""insight"" about Venus? Which the article states that Venus is too dangerous to go to anyway. It angers me that half of New York could be underwater in the next thirty years from global warming but we are worried about getting a small peek into the world of Venus.

I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity. But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first. In conclusion, no, I do not beleive that the author of this article did a good job at explaining why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it. Because in the end it's not just the dangers of going to Venus that keeps me from beleiving that we should. It's the problems that we are facing here on Earth that are far more important.",5
2101c39,"Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be. Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet. The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur.

One thing that the article mentions is that the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so.

Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery.

One last thing that the article mentions is negative about the developement of driverless cars is who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with.

With all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars. Becuase of all of these problems that arise with the cars it is just a gargantuan risk to implement these cars into our lifestyles. ",5
21133d1,"Throughout the essay ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does a good job of suporting the claim that studying Venus is worth while. The author provides examples and counters them with ways to overcome said obstacles, and uses specific examples on how NASA plans to study and explore Venus.

Venus has many different aspects and characteristics from Earth, such as the temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. Geological and weather challenges include lightning strikes, erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes. The author mentions all of the issues regarding visiting Venus in the second and third paragraph. Although the author mentions the challenges, he/she is doing that to completely inform the reader by giving all the details and then finding ways to counter those obstacles. The author brings up the question of ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" in the beginning of paragraph 4. This shows how the author brings up an argument against the initial claim, and then proving that argument wrong to make the claim more valid. Next, in the fifth paragraph, the author uses evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to provide ways to escape the hostile conditions of Venus. For example, one idea is to allow scientists to float above the fray in a blimp like vehicle. Again in the second paragraph, the author again mentions another plan by NASA to study Venus. This plan is to use simplified electronics made of silicon carbide because they could survive Venus's surface for a limited amount of time. By using specific evidence and research already done by NASA, the claim that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" is being proven well. Lastly, in the final paragraph, the author does an excellent job of summarizing the scientific gains that would come from exploring Venus. The last line states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" which is a fantastic summary of the article and shows how well the author presented and supported his claim.

In conclusion, the author uses excellent writing skills to support and validate the initial claim, and does it very well. The author thoroughly analyzes each danger and possible solution, and also states the positive effects of traveling to Venus. By using specific evidence and research from NASA, and countering all of the dangers with possible solutions, the author supports the claim brilliantly.",5
211d058,"To what lengths will one go in the name of discovery? In the article, ""The Challenge of Expolring Venus,"" the author goes into great detail descrbing the dangers of venus in regards to overall climate and pressure. However, they also state that its striking similarties to Earth would make the arduous trip worth the while. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author strongly supports their idea of supporting travel and explorations of Venus through use of tone and argumentation skills.

Venus, commonly known as Earth's ""twin,"" is a planet often regarded with mystery and wonder. The author states that, ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft... unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived... more than a few hours"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2). Doing so, they introduce a sense of uneasiness to the reader and a need to continue reading. Then, the author goes on to counter this with comparisons to Earth-like or somewhat survivable conditions on Venus, such as similar radiation and airpressure levels. According to the author, Venus has ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 6). By introducing this counter statement, the article's author attempts to downplay the immense risks and gives a sense of reassurance. overall, the author harnesses specific tone elements to support his argument.

Throughout the article, the author emphasizes the dangers and horrible, risky conditions of Venus, but successfully counters them with agruments providing evidence to the benefits of exploring and current steps taken to ensure safety and possible missions to the planet. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hositile conditions... would allow scientists to tfloat above the fray"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 5). The author attempts to formulate arguments that would make a trip to Venus a seemingly ""indisputable"" option. He also goes on to highlight the fact that although modern and flexible technologies would be unable to withstand the acidic and extremely hot climate of Venus, NASA is looking to reinvent the mechanical computer system used in World War II. In doing so, the author gives valid evidence to the reader, provoking thoughts in support to the article's claim.

Venus is a dangerous planet, but the curiosity of the human race appears to trump the fears of exploration. The author of the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" utilizes strong tone and compelling counter arguments to support their claim. The article also displays arguments from both sides, and allows the reader to understand the risks, but also be wooed by the oppsing view. This provokes the question, is there ever truly a limit to man's curiosity?      ",5
2140b9d,"I think that driverless cars shouldn't be developed. These cars shouldn't be developed for many reasons. As of right now, the cars still need driver assistance, but in the future they may not. What will that lead to though? These cars are not completely safe and accident free, many thingscan still happen. These cars shouldn't be developed because it can cause more accidents, the cars may malfunction and the driver wouldn't be capable of conrolling the car themselves, and then there is the problem of some people using these driverless cars, and some people won't be able to use them, which could cause problems as well.

One reason why this car shouldn't be developed is because it can cause more accidents. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver states, ""The car psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge. We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" He is basically saying that this is actually a pretty big challenge, because there are safety requirements that need to be met. There is also no laws for these cars. What happens if someone gets injured? Who is going to be reliable for the injury? Laws are writtern with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This seems to be true. You can't always rely on robots, as I know you can't always rely on people, but when it comes to crunch time, and you need to make a big decision on the wheel, people are going to do what's best for them, robots are only going to do what they have been controlled to do. Also, these cars can only handle functions up to 25 MPH. There are speed limits that are way above this, and since there are no laws that would help it, the driver may get tickets for noy following the law of the speed limit. Whe you look at the facts, this could cause serious disruptions, serious injuries, and many mishaps on the road.

Another reason why these ars shouldn;t be developed are because the cars could malfunction at any time. You can't always rely on robots. They are only programmed to control certian situations, not all situations. As of right now, the cars aren't reliable enough. It states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" We need to take these things into consideration. Many people are ignorant, and may not pay attntion to te notifications it sends out. This is an accident waiting to happen. What if the driver doesn't hear the alert, or isn't paying attention becaause they give full control to the car? Then things will go wrong, which could lead to accidnets or injuries. Also, it says that the car steers, accelerates, and brakes itself. This can cause problems as well. Since everyone won't have these cars, the car is going to have to rely on the other drivers on the road with them. They are going to have to worry about when the car in front of them goes or stops, when they pull out or pull in somewhere, if an accident happens in front of them, or if there is a road condition that they need to avoid. Also, there is the scenario with lights. WIll the cars be able to stop at lights, or stop signs on there own? If not then this could cause huge accidents.

The last problem is that some people won't be able to use them, and if they do, not efficiently. People, simply put, are stupid, so why would you rely on them to take over a car when the car stops working by itsself? You wouldn't. Some people also have disabilities that can cause them to not hear or snese the notifications, and well there is people who won't be paying attention to the =m either in all honesty. You have to put these things into consideration when making these revolutionary chnages to the world. One incident in the programming could cause serious catastrophic events. Also, not everyone will be able to afford one of these cars. If people can't afford some of these cars, then that woudn't be safe. There would be some drivers that would have the cars, and some that won't. Basically what I'm saying is that some people will go off their instinct and knowledge while driving, while others go off computer programming.That isn't a good idea, ebacsue usually people use signals with each other to figure what they need to do, but the car won't be able to do that. It just isn't safe for the roads to have both driverless cars, and cars that need drivers in them at the same time. People may argue that these kind of ideas are good, and that after all, the cars may be revolutionary and help the world. It's just that robots can't be trusted, as certainly as people can't be either, but people will be able to make the best decision based on the current events at the time. Just think, have you ever seen Irobot? Anything could happe, and many malfunctions could occur.

To basically sum this up, the development of these cars are a bad idea. There will be many more accidents, more malfunctions, and the incapability of people wouldn't help any either. I think that this is a very bad idea, and as much as I want it to be a good diea, I just can't see it turning out fot he best.   ",5
2150433,"Cars have long been viewed as a common method of transportation from point A to point B. However, in the world that we live in cars have become a burden and limited use would be best. Efforts to reduce car usage have shown to reduce the rate of carbon dioxide produced and smog. The elimination of car use would lead way to further development for other methods of transportation. Countries have taken the first step in banning car usage and its citizens have admitted to living nice and happier lives than they had before.

Common issues faced by car use is the production of carbon dioxide and the risk of smog. Smog is a health hazard to those with asthma, young children, and the elderly. By limiting the use of a car, carbon dioxide and smog rates would plummet dramatically. When Paris was faced with smog at near-record levels driving was banned and after a day of the driving ban smog levels were dropping already. Cars, a major contributor to carbon dioxide production, can decrease the rate of the greenhouse effect by limiting their use. Nearly 50 percent of the United State's greenhouse emissions come from the use of cars alone. By not driving your car the rate of greenhouse emissions would drastically decrease.

Besides the nice look to a car, cars are often used because there appears to be no other way to travel long distances. Other methods of transportation such as riding a bicycle, public transportation, and even walking are viable and beneficial methods of transportation. On bike you travel further than you would walking at a faster rate, Bogota has begun the develpment of 118 miles of bicycle paths in hopes of reducing traffic and carbon dioxide emmisions. A near 80 percent of appropraitions are used on highways, the rest of the 20 percent are used on other methods of transportation. By finding other methods of transportation (ie. walking, biking, public transportation) the 80 percent used on highways could be used to greatly improve other methods of transportation, like public transport.

The thought of parting from our cars is a terrifying idea, however countries around the world have taken the initiative and made these ideas law, laws that are benefiting their copuntries. In Germany an ecperimental community, Vauban, has little to no car activity. 70 percent of its families do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to the community. Startingly, not only is this small community a success but many residents claim to be happier than they were when they owned a car. Columbia, like Germany banned the use of cars for one day in Bogota. Not only is everyone enthusiatic of the event but this day has led to the reduction of smog in Bogota.

The question to drive a car is a simple one. Why drive a car when you can walk, ride a bicycle, or can take the bus? By limiting our car use we'll reduce the rate of carbon dioxide emissions and smog. Other countries have tested and proven that life without a car is not only realistic but very beneficial to how one feels. With the options of other forms of transportation we should limit our use of the car. In doing so we'd be improving our lives and the rate of the greenhouse effect.       ?    ",5
21a4446,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school.

To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..."" (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the ""software can also identify mixed emotions"" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can recieve from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise.

In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer coud show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, ""according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better.

Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.                 ",5
21a8d76,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", Venus is explained to be very dangerous, harsh, and challenging. In this article, the author suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. While the author does explain the harsh matters of the situation, he still supports his ideas and reasons on why Venus should be worth exploring.

In the article, the author states that, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."". This quote has good meaning and reasoning on why the author feels that Venus should be worth exploring. With this quote, it is noticable that the author believes in taking risks. In this case, the author believes in taking a risk this big and challenging because it is greatly fascinating by astonomers and it will provide a great amount of knowledge that was once never known before. It will provide a sense of accomplishment, not just for NASA, but for everyone who wants to know what is living on places outside of Earth.

The author states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditons, but survivable for humans."". With this quote, the author is showing how he does understand the difficulties and dangers of going up and exploring Venus. The author is listing a challenge but still comes back with a reason why Venus should be worth the pursuit. In this quote, specifically, the author thinks the pursuit is worth is because humans will still survive that challenge. It may be harsh, but it can be accomplished.

In the article, the author also states, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."". In this quote, the author is stating that if scientists want to know more, explore more, and seek more about Venus, then they are going to have to get very up close to it. The author is stating that yes, it will be dangerous, but it should be thought of as a challenge, not given up on. The author feels that a challenge like this should be accepted.

In this article, the author feels that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. The author ends with this statement, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". The author is stating that if Venus can be accomplished, so can a lot more. ",5
21b9c41,"In the modern world, we are almost completely dependent on our technology to get us through the day.? These human creations, such as, cellular phones, the internet, computers, and cars make it easier for us to perform everyday tasks.? But for such heavy use of these items, there are side effects.? Cars in particular can, and will, create lasting issues in our environment, which if not resolved will cause many problems in our future.? But there is hope; if the First World states like the UK, France, Germany, and the U.S. were to cut down on car usage, we would see a drastic decline in not only the air polluting greenhouse gases, but also expenses for families spending all their money at a gas pump.? Furthermore, we would see an increase in other things, such as the amount of exercise and public people would acquire through alternative transportation.

The foremost issue is of course, the environmental effects of cars.? According to the New York times, cars are on average responsible for ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas"".? These emissions can often make cities uninhabitable.? In places such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other urban centers; heavy pollution requires citizens to wear gas masks, and acid rain devstates plant life.? This heavy pollution has such an effect that it causes black snow in Russia, thousands of miles away.? But the scale of the problem is much larger than acid rains and black snow; our planet is heating up, and greenhouse gases are to blame.? If you want evidence just look at our neighbor, Venus.? Roughly the size of Earth, scientists believe that Venus once has water, but look at it today, and you will see our solar system's hottest planet.? Several million years ago Venus was overcome by volcanic activity; of much greater extent than anything ever seen on Earth since it's formation in pre-cambrian time.? These volcanos spewed thousands of tons of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, and thus began the greenhouse effect.? The sun's rays would pierce through the smog and reflect off of the surface of the planet, but when they went back up the smog stopped them and turned them away, back down towards the planet's surface.? This caused the planet to practically absorb all of the energy and heat of the sun.? Before long the surface temperature became hot enough to melt lead, making Venus utterly uninhabitable.? If nothing is done to stop atmospheric pollution, this is our future.

But in our modern world many people would be completely lost without a car, it has become the staple of our infastructure, not unlike the horse from years past.? But there is evidence in the small town of Vauban, Germany; that life without cars is a very possible thing.? The small community of Vauban has forbidden cars within their town, and the results are suprisingly positive.? Of the residents of Vauban, seventy percent do not own cars, and are very happy with their circumstances.? As Heidrun Walter said to the New York Times, ""When I had a car I was always tense.? I'm much happier this way.""? While other states might not have such successful car free zone's, Colombia has an annual car-free day in their capital of Bogota and surrounding cities.? This day often has millions of Colombians biking, and walking from place to place.? There has also been an improvement in city beautification according to an article by the Seattle Times, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks . . . and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""? Not only does the restriction of cars help the environment, it can also help the economy.

The average American citizen's budget consists mainly of two things, housing, and vehicles.? But during the recession of 2008, there was a decline of about nine percent in average miles driven.? The burden of gas prices and car payments became too much for many unemployed Americans.? But after the recession passed, the decline continued, and may soon accelerate.? The New York Time states that ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.? There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age"".? If this trend continues, then we have already taken the first step in curbing our greenhouse gas emissions; and by doing so, we may increase the living standards of our citizens who would have more money.? As well as repurposed government funding in other cleaner and faster forms of transportation due to a lesser need in road construction and maintainance.

Finally, the world we live in today is changing, and with always increasing technology, it may not be long before a clean alternative to gas burning vehicles arises.? But you cannot count on the unknown; and what is known is that should we continue on our current path, the world will be a very hot place by 2040.? Either we must change, or our cars will die with us.    ",5
21f7c6a,"Dear State Senator,

Im going to tell you why im in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I will give you a few reasons why we should keep the Electoral College and don't worry I will also tell you some stuff, that's not really good to keeping it.

Lets start off with the first reason why we should keep the Electoral College. The first reason is the big states. I probably have confused you but let me explain to you what I mean. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, in 2012 the popular vote was really close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote. In other words, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The second reason why is, avoiding run-off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; which would highly complicate the presidential election, which is reduced by the Electoral College. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state; for example, Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Next reason is swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate, as we saw in 2012's election. The voter who are in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, really listening to the competing candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Now im going to tell you something bad about keeping the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Let me ask you a few questions, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding for public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? Well, sometimes state conventions, or state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Did you know the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

I'll admit that the Electoral College is a bit unfair and irrational...but there is also some really good reasons to keep it. No matter how hard it is to decide, I have stated my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. To me I believe that Bob Dole was wrong when he said, ''Abolish the Electoral College!"" We should not abolish the Electoral College but instead, keep it and maybe make it better.    ",5
2211051,"To acess what one needs in the world today, many would think one needs a car. Currently, cars are a big part of transportation for many people. However, they are also major contributers to negative environmental impact as well as the decline of cities public areas and transportation. Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can be benefcial to many. Currently, throughout the world several car free systems are operating well. A decrease in the number of cars on streets and highways would lead to positive improvments in public spaces, public transportation, and the environment as a whole.

Automobiles are one of the biggest ailments to the sustainment of a healthy environment. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog."" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change.

The reduction of cars also leads to development. In ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, improvments to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up."" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't? use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport.

As many begin to see the importance of car reduction, they are becoming less reliant. In ""The End of Car Culutre"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny."" In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. ""The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary.

The decrease in usage of and reliance on cars is important and positively impactful. As number of cars on the road continues to go down, so do global issues such as the deterioration of the environment. Communities grow to orient themselves around public spaces accessable to all. Getting a significant number of automobiles off the road plays a huge role in inciting change that benefits a wide array of people in the way of work, time, money, and more, in communities and worldwide.

2235d96,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.

The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.

The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin's team an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The text also states that, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in this picure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.

Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it ws winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren't revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face. Some say that the landform was created by aliens, but there is proof that aliens had no part in the formation what so ever. Few scientists believe that it's a alien artifact but with pictures, alien markings would have been noticed. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",5
2274cbb,"The author of this article demonstrates and tells us a variety of factors that contribute to the fact that although Venus has several dangers surrounding it, the idea of studying Venus is worth the persuit well. Throughout the passage the author tells us the pros and the cons Venus has, but he somehow continues to try to persuade the reader that if more research and studying is done, it will all be worth it in the long run. Not only does he tried to persuade us, the reader, with his writing, but he also includes several facts proven nationwide by professional companies and sources.

The author solely begins to reference NASA and how they play a role in advancing the knowledge of Venus throughout the course of studies. He uses evidence such as, ""Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Just as our jet panes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condtions by staying up and out of their way."" The text also states,"" Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author includes this to give the reader a reasonable idea of what one of the largest space companies has come up with to begin to send humans to Venus. Furthering his persuasion, he continues to include details in the text about some of the innovations many researchers are working on that could contribute to expanding our knowledge of Venus.

Following the details of NASA and their idea to visit Venus, the author includes evidence about some of the many innovations researchers are working on, along with how NASA is contributing to help better these innovations. The author does a very good job at describing some of the innovations created, and how they will help contribute meaningfully to our discoveries of Venus. The text states,"" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The text also states,"" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computer. Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Although the author does a very well job at trying to persuade the reader that studying for Venus is a worthy pursuit, I completely oppose his idea and what he is trying to do.

My claim of this article is that all the research of Venus and trying to pursuit the idea that it will all be worth it is false. It will not be worth it, and I can support my answer with several different ideas from the text. First, the text states, "" No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This is a major reason because if something like a spacecraft made out of hard metal, with a weight of a couple tons can not survive for more than a few hours, imagine what could happen with the human body. Secondly, Venus provides a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and contains clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid which if the human body is exposed to, can deteriate and die at an instant. Lastly, on Venus's surface, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what us humans currently experience on Earth. These conditions also have the capability to liquefy many metals. With these kind of statistics from the planet Venus, there is no realistic survival chance for any human body, which is why I completely oppose what the author in this article is trying to do.

The author of this article supported his claim that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Although he properly demonstrated why he supports furthering studies, I oppose his idea as I read the statistics from Venus and why furthering investigation of this planet would be in reality pointless. This concludes his reasoning behind wanting to continue studies, along with why I chose to oppose his idea of Venus.      ",5
227691f,"As we should know, ""the Electoral College is a process not an actual place. It serves as a compromise of the presidential election in Congress and by popular vote"" (paragraph 1). It can be good at times but most times it has its downfalls. The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. Also, there isn't a fair number of votes for each presidential candidate per state. If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster. I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall?

First of all, the Electoral college isn't a direct election. ""Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment"", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself.

It's not only an indirect election but it's also an unfair election. The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. ""One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators."" (paragraph 3). This is unfair because the number of ""House"" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who beleive their votes doesn't count becasue of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor.

Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives"" (paragraph 12). This is an unfair method also becasue now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause contreversy in the public. ""The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued"" (patagraph 22) but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the ""most thoughtful voters"".

All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.    ",5
2290a15,"The Electoral College has been around for many years. It is not an actual college, or location. It is a process where American citizens select their electors, however proceeding that the electors make their votes for President and Vice President; Congress counts for electoral votes. But, the Electoral College is a very controversial process, many people are for it, but many are also against it. Some even wanting to get 'rid of the Electoral College overall. We should ban the Electoral College for it does not satisfy American people.

Electors in the Electoral College can vote for whomever they want, giving American people the wrong idea and vote for the wrong presidential candidate. In the article (source 2) ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This quote from the article shows that not always can the American people be guaranteed who their electors vote for, and electors can give voters the wrong information and vote for the opposing candidate. This would be going against American people, dissatisfying them. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" American people can be confused, infused with the wrong information by Electors, and vote for a candidate that has no interest in carrying their state.

Larger states get more attention than the smaller states due to their high number of electoral votes. In the article (source 3) by Richard A. Posner it says, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Obama had won 29 electoral votes in Florida (high number) due to him making speeches and campaigns throughout the state. Paying his upmost attention to that state due to the high number of electoral votes he was trying to gain. Whereas in a smaller state such as Wyoming, he would not want to waste time paying much attention there where he can only gain 3 electoral votes! This is simply unfair and at most dissatisfying for the citizens who live in the smaller states with low electoral votes such as Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island, etc.

The Electoral College has been around for a long time, and in the end we DO receive a president in the end. But, imagine if this unfairness keeps going every four years an election happens. American people not being guaranteed their candidate, smaller states not getting as much campaign as the larger ones, etc. We do though, receive a president in the end. But what if it's a president that we do not want? That we were not fairly given? Just look at what happened with George Bush! There are many simple advantages to the Electoral College, but there are also many concerns that can outnumber.

The Electoral College should be gotten rid of because of how unfair it is to American citizens. If the issues with the Electoral College are not taken care of in the present, just imagine what our future elections will be like. Us American people need to take a stand against the Electoral College, and the process involved. Once a new popular process is created and introduced, it can provide us more justice and fairness than the Electoral College.        ?    ",5
22955c4,"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would be an amazing tool in the classroom. With it, lesson plans would be much more tailored to each person, and can easily be changed based on their reaction to the plan. This tool would improve classroom dynamics, improve students' attitudes towards learning, and would improve the overall understanding of more difficult lessons by students.

The classroom dynamic in most classes is not as helpful to students as it should be. When it seems like the whole class understands something, it can be embarrassing to ask for help. With FACS, if a student seems the least bit confused, the software can go over the lesson in other ways until the student is confident about the lesson and can move on. This means a more educated classroom with better grades and higher passing rates on standardized tests, which in turn, helps the school the students attend.

Often times, learning is seen by students as a chore. Reading and note-taking get boring and confusing. But if schools used FACS, the computer would recognize the students feelings toward the lesson and could use a more exciting lesson plan. This would then change how the student may feel about the topic and could even improve a student's mood. This could also improve grades, test scores, and school ratings.

FACS may also improve skills in certain fields. If a student was behind in algebra, a required class for graduation, this software may help keep them on track. Maybe Jane is having trouble with World History. FACS will recognize the confusion through her facial expression and will begin to change the lesson plan, therefore helping Jane and improving her understanding and appealing to different ways of teaching that better suit her.

Although some may say emotion may not be read properly or that emotions are too complex to be read through a few muscles and only six options, the auhtor of the article mentions that certain muscles (risorius and zygomatic major) can determine the difference between and fake smile and a real smile. So who's to say that all emotions don't have that same type of tell. Along with that, this program bases it's conclusion off of fourty-four muscles, and uses percentages of each emotion, which broadens what the person might be feeling instead of generalizing one emotion and working with only that.

In summary, FACS is an ingenius program that would improve classroom work and school function. Working with students and ecognizing their feelings on a topic may help teach them more individually and can lead to their better understanding of the concept. This innovative software would be a great addition to any classroom and would improve life in school. ",5
22ba497,"After reading the article ""Unmasked the Face of Mars"" I believe that these are just natural formed lanforms. One reason is because this face has many similar characteristics to landforms found in the west. Secondly, because the the pciture only show a natural land form after all. Lastly becuase because we have no affical proof that this was once a alien civilization.

One reason I believe that this is simply a natrual landform because of the many simularities it has with many of the landfroms in the west. In paragraph (12) it states that ""What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalnt of a butte or mesa land forms common arounf the American west. Also it states in the same paragraph that "" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars.""

Another reason that this text has caused me to belive that all the face is , is natural landform because when many people obeserved tha photo many belived that is was a natrual landform after all. In paragraph (7) "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for when the image first appeared on JPLweb sie revealing ....... a natural lanform. There was no signifigance of an alien mounument after all. Also earlier in the article in paragrph (2) it state that ""Sientists figured it was another martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia. Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh.

The third and finale reason why I believe that this is just a natural land form is beause NASA has simply no proof that this could possibly that there could have been once a alien civilization one Mars (Cydonia). In paragraph ( 2 ) ""Scientists figured out that is was only a common martian mesa, it was only the unusal shadow to make it look like a Egyptian Pharoh. Also on paragraphs (10) though(12) it states that the weather was clear and all they had found was that they had no signifagance to proof of an alien civilization on mars only to have simular characteristics of natural landforms quiet like the ones on earth.

On the other hand maybe its not a natural landform maybe some people may be right it could be some type of alien landform.

NASA could have done somthing to the pictures to mess with the hopefulls. In paragraph (8) states that "" The camera on board the MGS had to peer through the whispy coulds to see that face. Perhaps, siad skeptics , alien markings were hidden by haze. But this has no relevance because on there clear weather second attempt of getting a photo , they figured out i was just a natural landform becuase of the fact that in this photo it clearly dipicked that it had many of the same characteristics of natural landforms in the American west. This proves even though that that could have been a civilization it shows that it was only a landform.

In conclusion, all the Face of Mars is a natural landform because they didnt have any proof that this was an alien civilization. It had many of the same characteristics of many natural landforms in the American West and that it much of the research they had still proved that it was a natural landfrom because of there findings.

22eb6fa,"With the new Facial Action Coding System (FACS), scientists can now make computers to read and interpret human emotions revealed through facial expressions. One of the applications is using the technology in classrooms to analyze the facial expressions of the students during classes. Personally, I do not approve the value of applying this technology in classrooms to read students' emotions.

First, the FACS technology is a brand new technology with a lot of space for development. It is highly effective and useful in many different areas. For example, historians can use the technology to interpret the emotions of historical figures on paintings and photos. Psychologists can use this technology to aid understanding and analyzing the emotions of patients in order to reselove the emotional issues. The technology may be applied in law enforcement as well by analyzing the emotions of criminals and enemies to obtain useful inteligence. Also, as the article mentioned, FACS has a bright future in animation and video editing. With all the potential developments of FACS, using the technology just to analyze the students in schools to know if they're interested and engaging during classes seems like a waste of the asset. A good teacher is well aware of the students in the class. Teachers know if a student is interested. They can either catch the students' attention or teach without people paying attention. It would cost a great amount of money to apply FACS in all the schools. Instead of spending the money on the technology, it would be better to use the money on teachers' training programs and improving teaching regulations to make sure the courses taken by the students are benefitial and interesting, so the classes are more likely to attract students' attention. This is a far more effective method to resolve the issue than spending a lot of money and applying the technology on students who tend not to pay attention in classes. The main focus of the development of FACS should be on other areas which bring more benefits and possibilities to the future.

Secondly, it would be considered as privacy invasion to apply the FACS technology in a public location, like schools. Personal emotions are definately considered as personal privacy. People do not have the rights to spy on other people's emotions, especially when they keep their emotions to themselves. The FACS technology should not be applied in a way which gathering people's emotions by reading the facial expressions without permission. If it is being used in schools, it surely will be a mendatory requirement because students do not have more control over teachers. Emotions are one of the unique qualities owned by humans as a very advanced form of life. The creators of the FACS technology are supposed to understand the point and respect normal human emotions in daily life. In addition, the use of FACS in schools is relatively not applicable. Firstly, it requires a large amount of funds to apply the technology. Secondly, teenagers in high school are going through a stage of life where they are unstable emotionally and value their privacy greatly. There is no doubt that the teenage students would strongly oppose the idea of using FACS technology in the classrooms and observing their emotions all the time.

In conclusion, it is not of enough value to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify students' emotions in a classroom. Based on the two reasons previously mentioned, the effective way would be ensuring the students are interested and attracted by the classes, rather than finding out whether they're are paying attention. And, it is socially unacceptable and not applicable to apply the technology on students. Therefore, instead of spending the money and time monitoring on students' emotions, why not developing the FACS technology for other more influential and benefitial potentials?        ",5
2305032,"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be benificial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It is possible that this is partially because of the recession; many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the ""suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in"".? If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely benifical for the enviroment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 16-39 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is benificial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT benificial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, ""companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"". This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.       ?    ",5
2308e61,"People all over the world use cars to drive to work or take their children to school. To most people, the automobile is an everyday part of life. But there are downsides to the extreme usage of cars. Some people are noting this trend and are begining to limit their car usage. Two of the many advantages of limiting the use of cars are that it promotes alternative forms of transportation and it also reduces air pollution.

One positive effect of less cars is the improvement of other forms of transportation. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a car-free town, Vauban, Germany.?Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a car-free society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", written by Andrew Selsky, since car-free day began, bicycle and pedestrian-friendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage.

Another major advantage of limiting the use of cars is the reduction of air pollution. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", Rosenthal writes in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.

Overall, there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars. Not only does it promote and improve other forms of transportation, but it also decreases the amount of smog and air pollution, which are harming our environment.    ",5
2348e16,"Do Google cars truly work? Can humans completely trust a machine to do all of the work for them with their lives on the line? Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent, these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride, and not everyone can stay alert. Also, what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price, which can cause immense conflict. Therefore, Google cars should not be produced and sold to customers, for it will cause conflict and danger for everyone.

In paragraph seven, the author states that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road ""requires human skills."" Although the seat vibrates to get the driver's attention, it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough, which may cause a severe car accident.

Because of this problem, people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This may seem like a simple issue, but it isn't; people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight, the author questions this by asking, ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" If people get bored of waiting for their turn, then they will do something to get rid of their boredom, hence leading to a terrible accident.

When someone runs into a car accident, most people would blame the driver. In paragraph eight of the excerpt, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver of the manufacturer?"" Logically, both of them are at fault; the driver should have been paying attention, and the manufacturer should have known the consequences of selling the car. However, this will most likely unsatisfy the people. Everyone will get into a huge argument which will lead to an enormous conflict.

Google cars are an amazing invention, but it has some flaws; even if ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time,"" people should not trust the car. What about the other 10 percent? The 10 percent shows that it is possible that the car will get into accident, and that accident could lead to thousands of people dead. These accidents will most likely happen because people were not alert during the times they should have been. Can one trust these cars to take them anywhere with their lives on the line, or should they risk the 10 percent and hope for the best?    ",5
23dbca9,"I believe that driverless cars should be developed because of the many positive capabilities of the cars, advanced technology that is currently available and constantly being improved, and the safety features added by the driverless car.

One major consideration for the development of the driverless car is the environmental benefits. The Google cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars ""would use half the fuel of toay's taxis."" There is a large fear of increasing gas prices and lack of natural resources in the world today. The production of driverless cars would quell those fears as they are much more fuel efficient than the cars used today. Brin also states that the cars would ""offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This is crucial as the bus usually has a route that it must adhere to while the driverless car can go straight to the desired location. This aspect also positively impacts the environment. Similarly, the advanced technology that is already being created also helps with the development of the driverless car.

Beginning from the late 1950s, the concept of the driverless car was already thought of. Now, the concept is beginning to come to fruition due to the advanced technology created. The most important bit of technology on the driverless car is the spinning sensor on the roof, also known as the LIDAR. The LIDAR is able ""to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" Without the LIDAR, the accuracy of the driverless car would be greatly reduced as the car would have no sense of its surroundings. Another technology that was greatly enhanced is the antilock brakes. In the 1980s, the antilock brakes ""used speed sensors at the wheels"" to monitor when the car was becoming out of control. Back then, the antilock brakes only had a sensor to monitor the wheel's speed. Now, the antilock brakes have become more advanced to the point that they are able to ""detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" The antilock brakes have evolved from only having a sensor that monitors speed to sensors that can detect many dangerous conditions. The advancement of car technology greatly affects how safe and successful a driverless car may be. A driverless car would most likely not be able to work in the 1980s with the speed sensor as the antilock brakes. Now, the driverless car would be able to work very effectively as it combines a plethora of sensors and cameras to ensure safety. Speaking of safety, the driverless cars all have a safety feature that guarantees almost the maximum safety potential.

The reliance of a driver within the driverless car finalizes the development of the driverless car. If the car encounters a foreign situation, the driver will just be notified and will take over from there. This concept of passing over the responsibility of driving makes the driverless car very safe. As long as there is an alert driver within the car, the car is almost certainly not going to make any accidents. Car developers designed the driverless car to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" Thus, the car will do most of the driving and when there is a difficult situation, the human driver will take over. This ensure the utmost safety of the driver and the passengers as there is an extremely low risk of an accident occuring. There are ""driver's seats that vibrate"" and the Google car even ""announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This increases the safety of the driverless car as the driver will be notified when to take over. Therefore, the driver will also know the situation and will be ready to handle any troubles the driverless car couldn't handle. The safety features positively affect the development of the driverless car.

All in all, the cutbacks on the usage of natural resources, the advanced technology used to increase the safety of the driver, and the many built in safety features advocate for the production of the driverless car.   ",5
242cec4,"Imagine a world with cars that can drive by themselves; how easy everything would be! Now imagine everything else that must come with this new technology; society would need new laws, economy would need more money, and what would happen to the people? How would the people change? How much would this new technology affect our already-dependent-on-technology society?

The public distribution of driverless cars would cause a large-scale reformation of many aspects of society. This would include not only the cars themselves, but also laws, roads, and the minds of the people. As explained in paragraph 9, laws would have to change to accomodate these driverless cars, and to ""cover liability in case of an accident."" The process of making new laws will forcefully change how people think about certain situations, such as insurance. The making of new roads might come about, also, because the option of smarter roads is open; the roads worked ""surprisingly well."" This will also change our society and the mind processing of individuals, as they will become less independent.

Another characteristic of people wit driverless cars that will change is their ability to stay alert and focused. In paragraph 8, the passage explains that one way to battle boredom for the passengers aboard the car is to provide entertainment and information systems that will automatically turn off if the need for custom navigation arises. However, although this is an innovative idea, suddenly turning off the systems will leave passengers confused and perhaps angry, and neither of these reactions will keep the possible driver alert and focused enough to get the car out of danger quickly. The systems will be distracting and will linger in the minds of the passengers, which can be unsafe when the driver must take control immediately after being interrupted from his favorite television show. If the car then crashes, we must ask why it would have happened, if the systems were supposedly so safe and foolproof.

Other questions we would have to ask ourselves concern the costs of introducing driverless cars into society. In paragraph one, Sergey Brin says that these cars would ""use half the fuel of today's taxis."" However, this decrease in expenses cannot combat the larger amount of sums due to several aspects. For example, building enough cars to release to the public would be quite costly; in paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun says that some technology to build the driverless cars used to cost two hundred million dollars, and ""it wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" The process of building these cars and getting them on the road could be very long and very expensive, throwing the United States into even greater debt. Another problem would be insurance. Paragraph 9 says, ""Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident...who is at fault -- the driver of the manufacturer?"" This event could lead to a court case, and buying more insurance to cover more needs: none of which comes at an easy price.

""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" This excerpt from paragraph 10 shows that automakers are merely assuming that they can surpass any obstacle and fix everything. However, we must consider what might happen if these problems can not be solved. The costs spent on creating these cars would have been for almost nothing, and society will have to reluctantly ease back into the ""old ways,"" disappointed, thinking about what they could have had. It will be better in the long run to prevent the completion of driverless cars at this moment in time, when society and economy are not quite ready for it yet. It is an easy future we must be prepared for, but also look forward to.",5
244db43,"""Boom!"", was the the first thing I saw when I looked up from the passengers seat.Two cars had crached into each other.We were on route 33 going to Fort Wayne.The speed limit there is about 55 mph or 60 mph. Both of the cars were destroyed.On the road there were so many pieces of each car.The crash was extremely bad.The people inside were in a dangorous situation.We called 911 then the police arrived and a helicopter had to get a person and took them. since then the only thing that I think about is driverless cars.Driverless cars development would be

be much safer because they would stop before you crashed,they would accelerate alone, and people wouldn't have to worry about drunk drivers.

Driverless cars would help so many people out.The best thing is that they will stop before you crash into something.The article said that there are cars that can brake themselves.But the driver has to remain alert for when a situation requires it so they are still not that safe.With driverless cars you wouldn't have to be so scared because you would never know when you needed to stop the car.That would help teens out so much.In the TV I always see commercials on teens getting into car accidents and sending there last message to their father or mother.And that does happen because thousands of teens die from car accidents.I also read in an article that every person will get in a car accident sometime in their lifetime.It's really frightning.That's why driverless cars will save alot of people.

Driverless cars would be able to accelerate by themselves and that would be of much help.In the place I live their are alot of deer and there are alot of car accidents due to deer crossing the roads. And if the car could accelerate by itself then we would be able to have less deer accidents.the firt instinct that I have when we saw a deer when we were driving was to tell my dad to hit the break.He ignored me because he read an article that the best thing to do when your going

to hit something is to accelerate not stop.But to many of us we only think on hitting the break not accelerating.Driverless cars are just the best way to go.

There are many times when families die because the person that crashed into them was drunk.So driverless cars would make it safer for us and for them because if a person is drunk they wouldn't have to drive.That would make roads alot safer.The article said that maybe by 2020 some car brands like Nissan will have driveless cars which will be better for all of us.That way no one is in harms way becasue of drunk people.An example could be my cousin he was in a really bad car accident because the friend that was driving was drunk.He was in comma for 2 weeks and the had to do a brain surgey because he was in a very critical condition.The driver only broke a hand but my cousin got the worst.That happens so much these days becasue people are not responsible.I know that with driverless cars those type of accidents will be a thing of the past.

That is why driverless car development would be a better way to go becasue they would stop on there own,accelerate alone and people wouldn't have to worry about drunk drivers.It is something that every country should consider becasue all the gadgets people create are for a better future and I know that driverless cars are going to be the best thing created for the future.That way we will all be safer.

2450980,"Recent trends are showing that the average person is trading in their keys for a more contemporary mode of transportation, such as public transit or walking and biking from point A to point B. Even though the reason as to why this is occuring has yet to become clear, there are some general benefits that are known to come from this. More and more, cities in developed and developing nations are now being planned to be more dense, so that the citizens in them can get to where they need to be, without needing a car. Because of this, fewer greenhouse emissions are being created, there is less congestion and smog in cities, and the burden of traffic is being lifted from the everyday driver. The more this trend continues, the more beneficial it can become.

Climate change is a ubiquitous threat to the world. In order to face and reverse the direction of where the world is heading, some cities are finding new ways to face this issue. For example, a city in Germany has practically given up cars through its policies and design. Citizens are only allowed two places to park, and the city is designed so that everything you need is within a walking or biking distance, albeit more dense. More and more places are slowly beginning to adopt this style of suburb because ""emissions from an increasing middle class are choking cities"" (source 1). Making this change will not be easy, but it is important because ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent [...] in the United States"" (source 1).

Another issue that weighs down cities everywhere is the horrid smog and unbearable congestion most cities face. In order to combat this adverse effect of driving, Paris has banned driving in efforts to reduce the smog it deals with. The effort proved to create a temporary solution, as ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"" (source 2). A city in Bogota, Columbia has taken a day off from driving, and the results were so positive that the movement has spread to multiple cities in neighboring countries. This movement ""[left] the street eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (source 3).

In an ever changing world that exists today with cities that never sleep, the average person is constantly burdened and stressed by things that tend to pile up. So why have driving and traffic be added to that heap of annoyance, especially if it's avoidable? The fact is, driving can be incredibly stressful and sometimes border on superfluous. A resident of the densely populated german town where 70 percent of its citizens don't own cars claimed, ""when I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"", referring to how they no longer need to own a car or drive (source 1). The day of no driving in Bogota, Columbia has been said to be""a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (source 3).

Modern nations have revolved heavily on the invention and continuous innovation of the automobile. However, the increasing dependence on this mode of transportation has created some adverse affects for the general population of the world. In order to solve this problem, an emphasis on cleaner and more efficient modes of transportation must occur, along with more densely designed, modern cities. A larger independence from cars can create fewer greenhouse emissions, cause less congestion and smog in cities, and make the average citizen free from the stress of driving. Change will only ensue with a more proactive stance on this issue    ",5
247b49d,"The? Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers were;not always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electorals confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guarenteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the elcectoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candiates focus more on those staes to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.    ",5
2480abd,"A lot of people enjoy the rush of adrenaline. So much energy is rushed through a persons body when they do something that is looked at to be difficult or dangerous. Once they successfully achieve their goal they feel amazing but they do everything they can to achieve there goal even though it could possibly be very dangerous. This is just like in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". In the article it talks about how NASA is interested in studying Venus but they really can't because of all the obsticles they need to get by. But those obsticles don't matter to them. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Some ways that show that studying Venus is worth it is when it talks about Venus being one of the only planets being very similar to Earth, being one of the closest planets to Earth and the possible inventions that could be made that can change a lot in exploration.

Earth has very different characteristics from all the other planets in the solar system. So when astronomers discovered Venus they were fascinated to see how it has many of the same characteristics that Earth does. Since another planet has many similar characteristics to Earth it sparks curiousity. It starts to create questions which people and astronomers want answers to. So scientist and NASA want to do everything they can to answer some of their questions no matter the risk. In the text it says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" This shows how Venus is shown to be very similar to Earth. It has many similar charcteristics which shows there could have been life on the planet very long ago. The reason it is seen to be worth exploring is because if astronomers continue studying the planet then they could possibly maybe find a way to possibly live or find current creatures still living on the planet.

When people want to really know about something they will do everything they can to discover more. Especially when the thing you want to know more about is right next door. It's like having a child and candy. If there is candy right next to a child they can't be told not to have it and expect them to listen. They will go right for it since it is so close to them. That is exactly how astronomers feel. They can't resist the urge to study a planet that is so close to them. There are many other planets in the solar system which they can't study because of the distance from Earth, but this planet is so close. In the article it says, ""Often reffered to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closets planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This supports how the planet Venus is the nearest to Earth. Making it easier to arrive there distance wise. Yes, there are many dangers of visiting the planet which can make it seem very immature to even risk going, but that doesn't stop NASA. If they have something close to them they can continue doing test and possibly find a solution to reduce risk and fully and appropriately study Venus.

The other reason which NASA wants to continue studying the planet is because of the possible inventions or spark of ideas along the way. If there are new invention or ideas it could change things for ever in the future. It could make further studies a lot more easy. In the text it says, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape...a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide...have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.Another project is looking back to an old tehcnology called mechanical computers."" This shows how many great inventions can be created or even early inventions from before can be used. That leads to more curiosity and encourages NASA to keep studying Venus despite it's dangers.

There could be many reasons for why people would like to continue working on something no matter the risk. For example the study of Venus. NASA and many astronomers continue working on the study despite of the dangers because of Venus being one of the only planets being very similar to Earth, being one of the closest planets to Earth and the possible inventions that could be made that can change a lot in exploration.",5
2556150,"Technology today is beginning to support the possibility of driverless cars. However, there are many issues that would support arguments against the development of these cars. This radical idea is actually rather unrealistic, the technology required is far too advanced for any humans to develop in a safe manner. In addition, there are too many safety and law issues surrounding the automatic cars. Lastly, cars that drives themselves would be rather unbeneficial to people themselves. Development on driverless cars should not continue on farther than they already have.

Technology nowadays has advanced farther than we could have ever imagined. It's true that we have now accomplished what used to seem impossible, but how far is too far? Many of the cars that have been developed have incredible technology, but they all still require a reliable human driver. The farthest companies, such as BMW, have come are things like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can handle speeds only up to 25 mph, which is far below the speed limit on most roads. The cars are able to perform specific functions on their own, but are all programmed with things to make sure that the driver is fully alert since they can't handle more than slow and striaght driving on their own. The idea of completely driverless cars is unrealistic, which has been proven by the requirement that the cars need a driver to fully take them over in most situations. Too much time and too many resources are being put into an idea that may take centuries to develop, this time and resources could be put into more pressing issues.

In the states, it is illegal for driverless cars to even be tested. If they can't be tested in real life situations, then how will we ever get the chance to develop them? It's true that some states, such as California and Nevada, allow limited use of semi-automatic cars, but thats a far cry from allowing cars to completely drive themselves. The current laws are based off the fact that a safe, human driver is required to be behind the wheel. New laws would have to override current ones to allow such vehicles, which seems to be more trouble than worth. Aditionally, questions on safety play a major role in many arguments. Technology is wonderful and often helpful, but its never 100% reliable. When malfunctions occur, people will get hurt by the destructive weapon that is an automatic vehicle. Also, the question of who would be liable for the accident would arise; is it the manufacturer or driver? Many conflicts between individuals and large companies would begin to form.

Finally, driverless cars may cause more harm than good to the human mind. If the technology to have cars drive themselves is developed, then more and more things will evolve to ""improve"" human lives. In reality, this technology will likely promote extreme laziness in already unproductive beings. While behind the wheel, drivers would get bored and distracted absolutely doing nothing. Even though sensors and other technology are being developed that would quickly alert the driver when the vehicle is in need of assistance and keep them ""safely"" preoccupied, they are not full-proof. As with all technology, malfunctions would likely occur and cause accidents. Also, the driver may have a tendency to check their phone and do other distrating things if they rely too much on the technology, which would cause even more accidents. This again brings up the question of liability. Was it the driver's fault for not being alert or the manufacturer's for failing to alert them?

To conclude, the development of driverless cars should come to a halt. It is true that car technology has advanced greatly, but everything still requires a functioning human driver. This development is overshadowing more important issues of today's world. In addition, there are laws in place that prohibit driverless cars for a reason. It is nearly impossible to test out the development of these vehicles due to these laws, which should be a very obvious sign to discontinue these efforts. The largest issue is safety. Technology is not completely reliable and never will be. Especially in new developments, malfuntions and technical difficulties are very common. Things have been developed that may alert drivers and keep them from becoming bored, but they may promote bad habits. People would become increasingly lazy and become more unsafely distracted behind the wheel than ever. Don't support the development of driverless cars by making sure to be a safe, alert driver and understand how far too far is concerning the development of technology. ",5
2597102,"Dear Senator,

I respect and admire your position in office for you are always on your toes and doing work for your people. But one thing I do not admire as a citizen of the U.S., is the Electoral College in which our country goes by. When saying Electoral College I am meaning the process in which the election of the President by a vote is compromised with a popular vote of qualified citizens. By changing to a popular vote, everyone is equal and our location won't restrain us from our vote that we cast. The Electoral College may have suited our countries needs in the past but it is now time to abolish this unequal process.

To get things going, the Electoral College strays to many voters away. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Plumer brought to my attention that many voters are aware that the canidate that they want to serve as president does not stand a chance in their state and because of this they do away with voting. Personally, I feel that voting should be something that everyone partakes in. After all, if you didn't vote you shouldn't complain. But in the boat we are in now, we (US Citizens) are being taken advantage of and are rights are simply stripped away in this form of voting. In fact, one-half on eligible American voters did not vote in 2012 and I am sure the voting process we use has a storng influence on these people. If we were to vote, in some cases they won't even matter. This lets our location define us and not our beliefs.

This leads to the next point that it gives too much power to those we elected. Yes, we did elect them and we should have faith in them, but the Electoral College makes it very difficult to do. ""What Is the Electoral College?"" brought it to my attention that the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. So we simply place our votes in the hands of the minimal amount of people. I don't think so!

Lastly, did those serving in office think about the people at the bottom of the todem pole (average US citizens) rather than those at the top (serving in office)? ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Because of this, it becomes clear that my opinions and rights are stripped away. It completely disgusts me at the fact our nation is treating our citizens in this manner. It is time for those in office to think about who they are serving. Fifty-five people shouldn't represent 500,000. We should all be able to cast votes equally with the same credentials.

All in all, there are in fact some limited benefits of an Electoral College, but a direct election or popular vote would suit our nation much better based on our needs in the present. Through Electoral College it is much easier to recognize who won the election and a few more advantages, but it has become very outdated and unequal. It is time for change and we must act now!    ",5
25bb264,"Dear Senator,

If you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don't even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors ""vote for president and vice president,"" and then are counted by the Congress (Source 1, paragraph 1). They don't realize that their votes can be over-riden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.

Most voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, ""... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,"" (paragraph 9). Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. As active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. We want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not over-riden.

We need a system us as people can control ourselves. As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, ""Who picks the electors in the first place?"" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,"" (paragraph 15). It's outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.

As you probably already know, each state's ""...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation..."" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. ""In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all..."" and that campaign was refered to as a ""fiasco"" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).? This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) ""... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),"" (paragraph 20).

Selection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, ""... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,"" (paragraph 12). This shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly.

Altough many downfalls, ""The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose"" and ""avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,""(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22). Yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 50/50. Just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.

Therefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. We demand for a direct system! So I ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the Electorial Colleges.

Sincerly,

A concerned citizen.    ",5
264856a,"Driverless cars could be the future of our generation. Many car companies have taken this idea and are trying to pursue it. They are cars that, eventually, will drive by themselves. It seems like a very creative and speechless innovation. However, there are many questionable aspects of the car that need to be taken into account. I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. Teens will look past the greatness of being able to drive, and will look for another way to gain the freedom that they are desperatley seeking for. They also will not have anything that they are in complete control of. In the article it says, ""He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system."" If this happens, teens would not be in conrol of the car, the car would. That leaves kids to rely on yet another thing in their lives. Teens already have to rely on many things everyday. I think that if we add another one, and take away that sense of freedom, we will be taking away a big part of life. This is one reason I do not think driverless cars are a good idea.

Another reason I disagree with them is because of safety. Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, ""Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future.

The final reason I do not think that we should be excited for driverless cars is because of the law. If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky.

These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.           ",5
26983cf,"In this article, ""The Challene of Exploring Venus"", the author is explaining the difficulties of researching Venus closer, and why it is near impossible due to the challenges the planet provides. The author states what challenges the planet poses, and how scientists are trying to overcome those challenges. The author also says why the planet is worth the risk of exploration. The author supports the claim that Venus is a worthy persuit for exploration, disregarding the dangers, because Venus has many similar geological structures and could have once supported life due to the planet's simularities to Earth, but the author doesn't provide much more evidence as to why it is a worthy persuit.

In the same paragraph, a few lines down, the author gives examples of the similar features of terrain that the two planets share. The author says that, ""Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" The author means to that the planet has simlar geological features, in the next line the author expands upon what those are. The author states, ""The planet has a surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Through these two sentences from the article the author is contributing to reasons why exploration on the planet Venus is worth it, despite the natural dangers that the planet poses. The fact the two planets share similar physical characterists appeals the claim the author made about Venus being Earth's sister planet.

In the fourth paragraph the author gives a few reasons as to why scientists are further discussing the exploration of the planet Venus. The author says that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system, and it may have housed life at one point. In the second line of the paragraph, the author states, ""Austronomers are facinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This peice from the article shows that researchers, or astronomers, are intrigued by Venus because of it's simularities with Earth. Then the author goes into more detail about what those simularites are, in the same paragraph he states, ""Venus was probably convered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" In this sentence the author expands upon what those simularites are, and how the planets are similar because of their attributes, such as the support of different life forms. The detail the author inserted into the article about the resemblance of oceans is significant because life is not possible without oceans, and Venus had them.

Both peices of evidence that support what claims the author made as to why research into Venus was a good idea came from the same paragraph. The other seven paragraphs of the article expand upon why exploration isn't possible, how scientists and researchers are trying to overcome the difficulties that the planet provides them with, and what dangers there are. Only one paragraph from the article supports why exploration is intriguing to scientists. In this paragraph, the author supports why exploration towards Venus is being chased, such the similar physical characterists and the possiblity of life. The author doesn't support that idea of further exploration to Venus adequetly because they don't provide enough claims. There are two statements supporting why scientists are facinated by Venus. Why studying Venus is a worthy persuit is a minor detail in the article, the author does not do a well enough job in supporting the motivations behind the scientists.         ",5
26d36e5,"The Unusual Rock Formation

When the ""Face of Mars"" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. Many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. Although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. The reason being, was because NASA along with its scientists have many reasons for the ""Face of Mars"" to be a just a natural landform on Mars. They even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the ""Face of Mars"".

First, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. In the article, it states that photographing Cydonia became a priority of NASA. That this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. As the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

Furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. As the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. So, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. The reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. Even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. There are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. Also, the rock formation was in Cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that NASA immediately got informed by it.

Even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. In the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?    ",5
2705967,"Limiting car usage could greatly benefit the lifestyle of yourself and of those around you. Did you know that motor vehicles are one of the biggest causes of pollution and greenhouse emissions? According to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" If cars were completely eliminated for a week in an area like New York City, then pollution would be greatly lessened. It would be a good idea to try to take public transportation as often as possible, as opposed to driving to work every day.

Another good reason to limit car usage is to bring together community. There is a city in Germany by the name of Vauban (according to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal,) which completely bans driving cars. Inhabitants of this community walk or bike everywhere, which is also a good form of exercise that one could do in order to stay fit. The city was designed with walking in mind, and everything is close by as a result. If we were to have more of these communities, then green house emissions could be greatly lowered.

One major reason not to drive a car is that cars are often very expensive. If you live in an area where public transportation is an option, it may be worth it to not buy a car. You'd both help the environment and save a lot of money at the same time! If you're in a city or an area where many things are within walking distance, then you may also notice that there is a lot that you can do, such as walk to a mall or walk to a park, and you would not be harming the environment in any way.

Pollution is one major factor that should be touched upon more than once. According to a source named

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the large amount of people constantly driving, it caused the city to become so polluted that they had to ban people's ability to drive. If people carpooled more, or took more public transportation, then this wouldn't have happened. Some delivery companies even complained of ""lost revenue.""

Lastly, it is a good idea not to drive because of the quickly repleting fuel supply remaining on our planet. Sooner or later, we will run out of gasses to fuel our vehicles with, and we won't have a backup plan. Some areas won't even be remotely affected by this, and people have already created hybrid and electrically powered vehicles. Perhaps if you were to bike more and get used to the idea of not driving, then you will be ready for the inevitable to occur. Although you don't have to cut cars out of your life completely, it's a good idea to start relying more on things that won't run out.

Overall, driving is fun and gets you to far places in much shorter times than it would take you if you walked there. However, there are many dangers and negative effects that come from driving. To recap, the green house gasses that come from cars are dangerous and harmful to our planet, and there should be efforts to lessen these gasses, even it is simply by car pooling or by taking public transportation. Also, people's excessive driving caused an entire city to have to ban driving vehicles. This should probably be a lessen to those that drive a good deal; it's killing the environment!    ",5
274b414,"The Face in Cydonia on Mars is merely a natural landform because if NASA has proof that The Face was created by aliens, the evidence would surely be shared with the world. Also, the Face is similar to several types of landforms on the Earth, and NASA has photographic evidence that the Face was not formed by aliens.

As mentioned in paragraph 5 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Face has ""become a pop icon."" Because the Face has ""appeared in books, magazines, (and) radio talk shows,"" people have become brainwashed into believing that the Face on the planet Mars was created by alien forces. People claim that NASA is hiding the evidence revealing that the Face is actually made by aliens. However, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Not only would the proof of aliens bring in an abundance of excitement for Mars, but it would also gain NASA a great deal more of revenue. NASA

is not hiding any form of evidence towards alien-life on Mars, and the Face may not have anything special about it besides the fact that it looks ""like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

The Face on Mars is extremely similar to several landforms found on the Earth. As explained in paragraph 12, the Face is similar in design to ""a butte or mesa,"" which are ""landforms common around the American West."" Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, notes that the Face reminds him of ""'the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'"" In the Snake River Plain, there is a ""'lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.'"" This is evidence to support that the Face is no different from any other natural landform, and that people have no reason for speculation against that idea. Another big reason to believe this claim is because professional scientists have pictures for evidence against aliens.

Scientists at NASA have photographic evidence against the claim that the Face is alien-made. People who claim that the Face was created by aliens will state that the photograph taken in April of 1998 was not enough proof of the Face being a natural landform. As stated in paragraph 8, the photographers ""had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face"" because ""it was winter."" This means that any proof of aliens could have easily been hidden by the haze covering Mars. So, in April 2001, a better picture was captured. In paragraph 10, it is mentioned that this time the photograph was taken on ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" and that the evidence showed up with ""absolute maximum resolution."" This picture, in its high quality, proved that the Face truly was nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.

If NASA had any proof that aliens had caused the Face to appear, the evidence would surely be shared. The Face is close in size and design to a landform in Idaho, and NASA has photographic evidence that there are no signs of aliens anywher near Cydonia. Because of these reasons, one can clearly see that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. ",5
28028e0,"In 1976 a land form was found on Mars that looked very similiar to a human face. Some people's minds immediatly thought that it was from aliens. This would make no sense because there are plenty of forms like this on Mars. Aliens wouldn't build a form that looked like humans. If it was an alien there would be proof, and we would know. This theory is way to far fetched to be the truth because this is just like any other land form on Mars. We have tons of evidence that prooves that it isn't from aliens and the only ""evidence"" the people that think it was the work of aliens have is that it looks like a face. There theory holds no water, yet people still believe it. Just look at the facts.

They discovered the face-looking form on a part of Mars called Cydonia. On Cydonia there are lots of forms called Martian mesas. It was not irregular to find one where they were at. The fact that it looked like a face was just a coincedence. It only looked like a face because of the way it was shadowing. To actually be from aliens all of the messas would of had to come from them because it was just like any other. There is no way that aliens made any of the others. The only reason that this one is believed to be built by them is only because it resembles a face. I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find another form that resembled something, and then people would think that it was from aliens, but they're not. You can look at clouds and find shapes in them and people don't think aliens made them. Some think that just because it is on another planet that aliens must have made it, but it doesn't mean that at all.

When people first noticed that it looked like a face they immediatly started thinking that aliens were behind it because they thought that it looked like an Egyptian pharoah. How could an alien that lived on Mars know what an Egyptian pharoah looked like? They are a completely different planet, millions of miles away. Even if it is just a regular face, not a pharoah, still how would aliens even know what humans looked like? And, say that they did know what we looked like, still why would they build this land form to look like us and not themselves? It makes absolutly no sense. If it really was aliens they would want to build of themselves, so they get some credit. There is no way they would of made it of a completely different species.

There is nothing special about this form other than the fact that it looks like a face. It is exactly like all the other forms on mars. Conspericy theorists want to say that we, NASA, know that it is from aliens and that we're just trying to keep it a secret. That makes even less sense then saying that aliens created it in the first place! If we could find something that was really built by aliens, that would be tremedously great for us. If we knew that it was built by aliens we would be overwhelmed by excitement, and we would let everyone know about it. The cold hard truth is that it is just like any other form. The fact that it looks like a face makes some people suspicous, and we get that. Who wouldn't want to know that their is life on other planets, I know I would be amazed if it was true, but it isn't. This is just a really cool looking land form, nothing else. Aliens had absolutly nothing to do with it.

When this face shaped land form was found, even the people on the ship wanted to think that it was made by aliens. It would be great for everyone, especially NASA, but they quickly had to come to reality and realize that it was just like the rest, it just had a really interesting shape. Some dreamers still would like to believe that aliens built this land form, but they to need to soon come into reality. There are so many of these forms on Mars already. Aliens wouldn't want to build a land form that looked like a human. If it was from an alien we would know, and we wouldn't keep it from you. All real evidence shows that aliens were not involved what so ever, but some would still like to believe they were. Just look at the evidence, and hopefully you to will see that there is nothing special about it. ",5
28645f2,"Cars have been popular and widely used ever since they were invented. They offer a fast and efficient form of transportation across both long and short distances. In this aspect, cars may appear extremely beneficiary and useful in everyday life, but there are always downsides to great inventions, especially the invention of the car. More and more people from all around the world are realizing the harms that car usage brings and are beginning to abandon their cars altogether. The most apparent reason as to why cars are damaging is because of the great amount of greenhouses gases they emit into the atmosphere. They also bring about pollution and smog with them. Finally, and maybe surprisingly to some, people are actually happier without these pollution monsters.

To start, cars expel shocking amounts of greenhouses gases from their tailpipes. By limiting usage of these automobiles, the amount of green house gases can be significantly reduced. According to the source,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, cars produce up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in places like Europe, but an eyepopping 50 percent in the United States where there is heavy car usage. This is a lot of noxious gas that is being put into the atmosphere, and poses a serious harm to the people living in these cities. Greenhouse gases are an especially maleficient form of pollution because greenhouse gases tend to trap heat and other types of pollution from escaping the atmosphere, leaving filth in the air that are then absorbed by the lungs, ""choking cities (Rosenthal 8)."" This is without a doubt a serious problem, but it can be corrected simply by not driving as frequently. According to

The End of Car Culture,

""But America's love affair with it vehicles seems to be cooling...If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants (Rosenthal 32-34)."" Simply by reducing car usage, these harmful toxins can be removed from the atmosphere.

Pollution is another quite obvious reason to why restricting car usage is benefical. Cars release other toxins and gases as well that contribute greatly to pollution and smog.

Paris bans driving due to smog tells the story of how driving had to be banned for days because of the worst pollution the city has ever seen. According to this passage, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 144 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found (Duffer 14-17)."" This is a ton of particulate matter that will be all breathed in by the people there if they are not removed. Paris, Brussels, and London are not only the cities plagued by this pollution from cars as ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world (Duffer 14)."" Smog from pollution negatively effects many aspects of life, but the worst was that ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions (Duffer 14)."" This phenomenon forces the people to breathe these particles into their lungs. Pollution is a terrible occurence that tags along with car usage, but by simply banning cars with even-numbered licnese plates off the road for one day, the smog greatly lightened in severity, enough for the city of Paris to lift the ban. No one wants pollution in their city, and simply by cutting back on car usage, pollution can be greatly reduced for the benefit of the people.

Finally, and most surprisingly, people are actually happier and less stressed without these modern horses. Heidrum Walter, a mother who lives in the city of Vauban Germany, a community devoid of cars, says in the passage,

Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , ""'When I had a car I was tense. I'm much happier this way (Rosenthal 3).'"" Carlos Arturo Plaza, a man in Bogota, Colombia, also commented during Bogota's Day Without Cars, (in the source,

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota

) ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution (Selsky 24).'"" This may seen a little puzzling at first as to why people would not enjoy fast and convenient transportation, but then the answer becomes pretty obvious. Without cars, parks, sport centers, and other outdoor recreational places have started to pop up more amd more on the streets of cities once bustling with cars. The roads are much less congested and new shops and food centers have appeared as well. Limiting cars pleases people in many different aspects of their life.

Cars may appear to be helpful at times, but in reality, citizens are better off without these transportation machines. Not only do they greatly pollute the air and cause smog, they also spew out noxious greenhouse gases that cause more damage to the society as a whole. Finally, and probably most importantly, the citizens themselves enjoy life better when these cars are out of them. Although this doesn't mean cars should stop being manufactored altogether, people should think twice before jumping in their car next time.    ",5
287b18b,"Through the development of driverless cars, there are many postive or negative aspects that can be contributed to their manufacturing. Overall, I beleive that with these developments and engineering that has gone into the manfucaturing of driverless cars, we have improved the safety of regular automotive vehicles and the standards that safety should be set at. While the development of accessories that are created for safety are commonly used in these driverless car, these safety measures can be used in development of everyday vehicles.

When creating the idea of driverless cars, many furutrists have come upon the idea that we do not need smarter cars; we need smarter roads. The development of roadways that General Motors and engineers at Berkeley tried to use were incredibly advanced. The roadways at General Motors provided the invention of an electrical cable that was to be embedded in the track, this would send radio signals to a receiver that was on the front end of the car. The engineers at Berkeley used magnets that had alternating polarity. With this new-found developments, these people created smart-road systems that worked incredibly efficently. With these developments that were made, the realization that smarter roadways may not be the correct option, but smarter cars truly hold the future. This lead to a new wave of developmental ideas.

With the development of smarter cars, automakers had come upon the manufacturing of accessories that would help everyday cars. While smart cars really do need an abundance of sensors, often times regular cars can be improved with these added. With the development of anti-lock brakes, the sensors were able to exhibit a better response and control compared to that of a human driver. The development of smarter cars has lead to furthering the improvements in sensors and the computer software and hardware that makes driving safer.

In 2013, BMW had annouced the devlopment od ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This vehicle was able to drive partially by itself, but int he event of work zones and accidents, it needed the assistance of human drivers. Soon, automotive companies realized that it was a necessity to have a way for a car to gain a driver's attention. Some of these companies had seat that would vibrate, an announcement system, and flashing lights on the windshield and other displays. Through this abrupt realization, manufacturers have begun the merging of these concepts into everyday vehicles.

Through the creation of driverless cars, we have made everyday cars safer and more reliable. They are now less liekly to cause accidents. If we further the development of driverless cars, who knows where the roadways will be in twenty years? We could have the ubiquitous use of driverless cars, perhaps they could become further assimilated, maybe laws will change for safer roadways. Perhaps our everyday cars will be the safest as can be. We really don't know, but so far, the develp,ent of driverless cars has seemingly revolutionized the automaking world and planted a new seed in everyone's minds about the future which only we can change.

In conclusion, because of the devlopment of driverless cars, we have made roadways safer with the creation that have come about through their manufacturing. Without the thought of using driverless cars and making vehicles and roadways smarter, there would be a lack of development in the technological safety of vehicles. There would be far more accidents because of the lack of ability to brake, which has been stopped since of the perfection of anti-lock brakes, and there would be a lack of ability for driver's to remain focused on the roadways without the development of vibrating seats in order to gain a driver's attention when they are veering off the road. They have truly revolutionized the car manking industry and the future that we will hold.",5
289c956,"The author supports his idea of exploring venus even though there are many challenges to complete the task. Some challenges that come with exploring Venus is that it has harsh conditions for human and and robots, but the NASA has been working on other approaches. Scientist would like study its surface because at some point in history Venus was somewhat like Earth. The author has answers for all the challenges that scientist have with exploring Venus.

Venus is the second planet from our sun which makes the planet the planet very hot reaching 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus also has a very thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide blankets, and as the author states ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our planet"" that pressure would easily destroy any metal. Another fact about Venus is that it has the hottest surface of all the planets in our solar symtem even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. So far scientist have been working on alternatives to explore Venus.

Humans have sent many spacecraft to land on Venus, but none of them have survived this shows why non of the missions have been named. but in recent times the NASA has been working on using electronics made out of silicon carbide because they had been tested in a chamber simulating the conditions of Venus. Another approach that NASA is looking foward to is sending ""mechanical computers"" this devices use gears and levers to make calculation and do no need electronics at all. Mechanical computers can be made more resistant to heat, pressure, and many other force unlike its counter part, modern computers, they can very flexible, powerfull, and quick, but they are more delicate being in extreme conditions.

Human survival can be possible in Venus with a space ship hovering 30 miles above the ground of the planet, the pressure would be very close to the one on Earth the temperature would be around 170 Fahrenheit also they would be plenty of solar power, and the radiation would no be more that what it is on our planet. In these conditions human life can be accomplish. Millions of years ago Venus was like Earth, how do we know? because Venus has features of Earth such as rocky sediment, craters and mountains.

The conditions in Venus make it hard to survive in the planet because its temperature can reach 800 F and the pressure is 90 times grater than what it is on Earth, life on the ground cant be possible on the rocky ground of Venus. Even though the conditions has very dangerous conditions exploration can be possible with mechanical computers. Life can also be possible if we find a way to hover 30 miles away from the ground because the temperature can be 170 F and the pressure would be like Earth. Life 30 miles above the ground of Venus can be possible.",5

The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use.? On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President.? While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results.? One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal.? This is crutial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (Posner).? With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them.? Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes.? It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (Posner).? Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory.? Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair.? It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win.? In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes.? This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency (Plumer).? The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates.? If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them.? The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives.? The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" (Plumer).? The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation.? All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign.? With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states.""? They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote.? In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited.? Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina (Plumer).? Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision.? Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign.? A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" (Posner).? Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President.? To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College.? The President of the United States plays an important role in our country.? The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country.? It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.    ",5
28e9a88,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The author explains how driverless cars have been introduced. The author also explains what possible difficulties or roadblocks the autonomous (or driverless) technology in driverless cars will encounter. After thoroughly reading the article, I have formulated my stance on driverless (autonomous) cars. I believe that driverless cars are the future of technology, will be more effecient, and will ultimately lead to less accidents when fully implemented.

The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" states the following:

""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the

creation of antilock brakes.""

After which, the article states the following:

""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect

and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers.""

The aforementioned quotes from the article show that technology in cars are steadily improving. These pieces of technology are growing more advanced every year.

As a society, we face three options. Of which, we may only choose one. The options are as follows: One, we may proceed in development of technology and progress as a whole; two, we may grow stagnant in progression and remain as is; three, we may choose to go backward in progression. I am in favor of progressing in technology and also in autonomous cars.

Autonomous cars will be incredibly more effecient than our current vehicles. In the article, the author states that ""The cars [Sergey Brin] foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Not only will autonomous cars be more effecient than any system we are currently using, but they will also be more flexible than our current public transportation system. The increased effeciency of fuel would lead to less pollution due to less fuel being consumed by each car. This is undoubtedly a large, positive aspect to autonomous cars. Overall, the combination of increased effeciency and increased flexibility leaves the outlook on developing autonomous cars very promising.

Implementing a full system of driverless cars will ultimately lead to less accidents. The majority of car accidents are known to be caused by human error. When implementing a system of driverless cars, there will be a fewer number of errors than occur in a system of human drivers. Even if an autonomous car were to have a bug in the programming, it is easily fixed. Once the bug is fixed, it no longer is an issue. However, with humans, there is the need to train every driver. Even then, human drivers still have room for error. A system of autonomous cars would largly decrease the number of accidents and would not require individual programming. Due to this, we could also automate several driving jobs, filling in any possible job vacancies.

I believe that driverless cars are the future of technology. The only path to take is forward. I also believe they will be more effecient. It is said that they will require only half the fuel consumed as of now. Finally, I believe it will ultimately lead to less accidents when fully implemented. Autonomous cars are far more predictable and offer less opportunity for errors. It would be a wise decision to explore the future of driverless cars and use this futuristic technology to our advantage.",5
2916425,"Dear state senator,

After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not effecient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. Although defying the people does not happen often there is still the risk of repeating history to a greater extent.

Continuing, the ''winner takes all system'' causes states with smaller populations to be ignored. According to source 3, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention. In contrast, it can be argued that no single region can shift a campaign greatly, nonetheless a single voter`s vote.

The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.

Please take into consideration my proposal,

Student A    ",5
2917d93,"Are cars necessary in today's society? Of course they are necessary. Now, are driverless cars necessary? I would argue that they are not. Cars have been around for about a hundred years, and not once has society put its foot down and demanded a car that drives itself. The driverless cars this article discusses are not actually driverless, they are not legal, and there is no telling what future problems may arise.

Shouldn't a truly driverless car not require a human at all? I personally believe a driverless car should be able to navigate itself without human interferance. If it requires a human, then what is the point of calling it driverless? In fact, all the driverless cars being created right now are designed to notify the driver when it approaches a work zone or accident. So, in case the need to have a human take over arises, an individual would have to be sitting in the drivers seat, paying absolute attention to the road, and await the moment the car will allow the individual to take over. Wouldn't that take away the nejoyment of owning a driverless car? I believe it is even more of a hassle than driving ever would be. A person would have to fight boredom and remain alert while doing nothing other than sitting in the driver seat. To all driverless car companies: driving is paying attention to the road, but the driver is actually engaged, making driving more interesting.

Not only are driverless cars not fully developed, but they are not even legal. Most states do not allow driverless cars. In fact, most states do not even allow driverlesss cars to be tested on their roads. The article only mentions four places that allow driverless cars, and they only allow limited use. If these cars are not even allowed by most states to out on the road for testing, imagine how long it would take to pass laws to get these cars approved.

A myriad of problems could arise pertaining to driverless cars. The article mentioned a very real problem in driverless cars: if something goes awry and someone in injured, who is at fault? These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions.

Driving has been central to the American way of life for a large span of time, and if manually driving cars has been working, why change it? Driverless cars have been beiong tested since the 50's, so there clearly is no rush in getting these cars on the street. Also, once these cars are available to the public they will most likely only be accesable to the rich. In time the driverless cars would be more affordable, but the original prices would be high. Driverless cars are getting attention, but as soon as the public knows they will only be for wealthy hands for a bit of time, the excitment will die down.

The system works, and it works well, so why change it? Driverless cars may sound high-end and futurisitc, but our cars now do the job well. Plus, there are hazads and roadblocks the driverless cars will have to overcome first. Should we really make state legislatures waste time debating the use of a driverless car that is not completely driverless? Driverless cars have benefits, but they are not street legal. I see no point in spending money for a car that cannot be driven in most streets and is not able to operate without a human there to takeover incase something goes wrong. ",5
29338c6,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea of exploring Venus despite the dangers because they believe it will (1) help technology advance further, (2) inform on what Venus was once like millions of years ago and (3) satisfy human curiosity.

The author believes that persuing the exploration of Venus will help further our technology. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" The author makes a point of saying that one of the main reasons Venus is so difficult to access is because we do not yet have the technology to withstand conditions there yet. However, if we were to start with a minor mission of searching for breakthroughs in what is currently possible and what can withstand all of the harshness Venus has to offer, then we can put that technology to other use that would be able to break the barriers of what humankind thinks to be impossible. The author sees Venus as a testing ground scientists can use to further develop technology with no real risk involved. Trial and error has no trade off in this situation, we only continue to experiment with what we know and question what could be.

Additionally, the author believes that there is still much data that can be collected from Venus to help human kind understand what the planet was once like. In paragraph 4, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" We are always trying to find other possible forms of life in space. Whether it's through radio wave length communication, satellite image, etc. we're searching for other planets that have the possibility of having other forms of life on them no matter if they're microscopic amoeba or just simply a small river. Science is desperately curious to discover what other planets have to offer in terms of supporting and sustaining human life. Therefore, if this planet was once able to sustain life or quite possibly if it did sustain life, that would be an incredible breakthrough considering how close Venus is to Earth. We could learn how the ecosystem was, when it existed, etc. We could even learn how it came to an end to compare to our panet and possibly save Earth from having a similar fate. The possibilities of the knowledge that could be gathered from Venus is endless and is unmistakeably worth indulging in to see what we can come up with.

Finally, the author gives the idea that Venus shoud be investigated to simply satisfy human curiosity. In paragraph 8, the author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Although the author does not directly say human curiosity is a main reason we should persue the exploration of Venus, the idea of it is subtley implied several times throughout the article. At the end of reading the article, the reader can't help but feel curious as to what Venus has to offer as well. It's simply the product of clever writing and expression of passion that this author has presented in a well informed manner. The reader wants to know if there was once life on Venus and if science can create the technology needed to withstand such an environment. They want to know, if that breakthrough technology is created, what other possibilities lay ahead for humans to further discover? The author secreted their own energy and enthusiasm for such a topic that can be so bland and uninteresting, and instead conjured up curiosity within the reader's mind, enthralling them and leaving them to ponder the potential.

Thus, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that the exploration of Venus should be persued despite the dangers because it will (1) push for breakthroughs in technology, (2) provide knowledge on the possibility of life having been sustained on Venus and (3) satisfy human curiosity on what Venus has to offer and what it could mean for the future of humankind.",5
296e7b0,"A life filled to the brim of better days is what we all want, and limiting car usage has some of these advantages. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter. The sound of children outside of the pollution free community is much more satisfying then getting somewhere with dangers involved. A life without cars is less stressful and more free to explore in safety. Driving tends to make drivers uneasy for fear or crash or being late to work from traffic.

""Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving."" Clearly being late to work and stressed is not something people favor espically when getting to work for free is possible. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" Instead of spending thousands of dollars expecting an easier lifestyle your neck rests on the chopping block with the blade ever silently above until it completes is mission. Having this ability feels like freedom but it's actually just a fear inducing, death causing machine. A simple healthier life on a bike seems more enjoyable, and even more so when it promotes good health and your life.

""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Not one person can really enjoy a twenty or fourty minute drive to a mall or anywhere for that matter. It's a waste of time, money, and life. Taking a 5 minute walk to a mall is much more beneficial to your body and health than adding gas to your lungs, and it's quicker too. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Children playing outside instead of inside on their new tablet could be our future again. Parents don't have enough time to spend thirty minutes driving to a park when their child seems content on their fancy iPhone 6. Shopping is also a favorite anywhere, but it seems to be drifting online. Taking five minutes to walk to the mall and save money on not buying a car or spending money on shipping will give more money to buy stuff! A bonus is no more wrong clothing sizes or ordering a lotion that smells like toliet water. Ease of lifestyle is a desire that can be fulfilled when waving goodbye to miles of road and hello to a new jeans that fit for once.

Pollution is a horrible topic that everyone wants to stop, however everyone is ignoring one of its sources. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" It sounds like Earth is becoming like the movie Wall-E, and next stop is a ship in space leaving this trashed planet behind. Paris is setting a great example at trying to remove pollution for healthier living and a better environment. The United States has clearly been challanged and in its effort to be the best it followed suit, ""...It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the evironment."" It is hard to imagine a healthy ecosystem with flourishing plant and animal life in our current situation. With Paris and the United States assisting in the idea of other transpot methods not only will animals have a better chance at not becoming extinct but so will the human race. Dying of pollution will no longer be a concern and money spent on poison can go to lifes other pleasures.

Happiness, fast travel, no pollution, and more new stuff sounds like owning a car right? Carlos Arturo has a taste of the sweet life, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Sadly this is not what a car provides because in fact it only reverses these good things. Despair sets in with fourty minutes waiting in traffic while clouds of gray swirl into the sky returning a shirt that didn't fit. Reconsidering the advantages of having a car and considering the advantages of limiting car usage is the right way to live a perfect life.    ",5
299a003,"Dear state senator,

There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens). As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote. However, even though there have been a few problems in the past about this system, the Electoral College is still the best method of voting.

It is hard to argue that there are some problems with the Electoral College. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. ""the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense."" (Richard A Posner). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" (Bradford Plumer). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.""(Bradford Plumer). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time.

However, despite the worries and concerns that some people may have, the Electoral College is still the best method for voting. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote."" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. ""Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.

All and all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids run-off elections and it makes the voters more aware, some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.       ?       ??????????

29a7d43,"I love us humans, and our little species-wide neural shortcuts. One example of a ""shortcut"" is face recognitioon. Our brains tell us what is human by looking at the face. The brain does have some flaws in this, though, because we tend to see faces where there isn't one. One of the most notable examples is the face on Mars. There is no way the ""face"" on the red planet was made by aliens, because as previously stated, the brain sees faces where there aren't any, the ""face"" is a common occurane on Mars, a mesa, and any alien proof would be seen in recent pictures. All of the evidence points towards the obvious conclusion, and the most likely scenario is probably correct, as Occam's Razor points out.

To begin, the brain tries to recognize faces, and it is really good at it. It says, ""Yep, that's a face!"" and that's because humans are social creatures. We need to recognize others that will be able to support us and stay together, because in ancient times, that, along with our ability to think and reason, was what we had going for us. As one source that I forget the name of stated, ""Pretty much the only thing we can outsprint by bodylengths per second is vegetables."" We could make tools and weapons to support ourselves, but to be effective, we had to team up. And that is why we see a ""man in the moon"". We see the face by craters. This is just the same thing, our brains being awesome at seeing faces, but not at recognizing the lack of a body to go with them.

Also, the ""face"" is a common occurance on Mars, a mesa. It is just a landform. This is shown by the NASA saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" The ""face"" is just a landform. The most recent picture shows the mesa in much more detail, and the face starts to fade away as the resolution increases.

As stated before, the picture resolution increases with each attempt at an image, and still no alien civilization! The article states ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" If there was above-ground alien civilization, we would have seen it by these pictures. The logical conclusion for the illogical is ""What if they are underground?"" and this is a valid point until you look at it more closely. To ""sculpt"" this landform, the aliens would have to dig out surrounding land, and that is hard, not impossible, but hard to do. And as stated before, use Occam's Razor. Also, they would most likely have to have some way to see humans, because the chances of aliens on a different planet in a different environment evolving similar faces to ours seems a little far-fetched. They would have some sort of visible, surface-bound satillite dish or something similar to recieve the signal.

Some might argue, ""Well, NASA is just covering up life on Mars."" and to that arguement, I say ""Good job! You are so close to logic!"" because while NASA could cover up the truth, they wouldn't do so. It would be good for business to discover some ""sentient alien life"" because the NASA budget would skyrocket! Everyone would want to know ""What they look like? Do they have a language?"" et cetera. Also, if they wanted to cover it up, no matter how much it would improve NASA, they have to release images publicly. If they managed to do some fancy photoshopping and release the images, there are people skilled enough to undo those photoshops and also, photoshopping leaves some computer traces around on an image, and there are plenty of free online sites that will spot those traces and show anyone where and how those touch-ups were made.

The most obvious conclusion is probably the right one, and all evidence points towards just a natural landform. The brain's ability to detect faces, the frequency of those landforms, and the ability to see alien civilization, if any exists, in more recent pictures proves the point of those who follow logic though the tinfoil-hat warriors try to say otherwise. Wait, is that a face in my soup?!",5
29ad56e,"Technology has been used for decades in education, from the basic computer to smart boards technology has been commonly used to improve the learning capabilities of students in modern times. The 'Facial Action Coding System'

technology has the ability to help professors and teachers around the world get more into the minds of their students and engage the students into a classroom where learning is not a unified thing, but more customized and free depending on student ability.

Firstly, with technology becomming more popular, an increasing number students are having the ability to learn through technology. Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding.

Secondly, having a program installed into the lense of cameras in students devices would open up new insight to teachers. For example, if a student watches a video lesson in a History class and is confused by something then their teacher could find the question, or peice of video, and simply adjust the lesson to fit the demographic and understanding of that child. There are many benifits to this technology including in the home, if a parent were to have the ability to see where their child was confused or frusterated the parent could also take some time to cover the missing material. This also prevents students who are fustrated but are to fearful or anxious to ask for help to not recive the assistance they need. This technology could open up door ways for students instead of them being lost in the information, but this technology is still new. .

Finnaly, one of the main reasons students do poorly in the current education system is that the student feels like they are not reciveing enough help or that they are lost. With average class sizing being anywhere from 22-32 students, a single or even two teachesr cannot assist all of the students individualy, and this creates a problem. Using the 'Facial Action Coding System' teachers can register which students need help and those who dont and pay more attention to the students who need help. This would therefore increase the amount of students able to retain information and help the school. Being lost in a lesson wouldn't be so common of a problem.

In conclusion, the 'Facial Action Coding System' opens new advancments in the the education systems by encourgaing an environment where teachers could have the technology to know when a student was confused or not understanding information, and also giving the ability for teachers to construct a lesson to fit the children who don't directly understand. It also proves a good method for parents to get involved in their child's learning and help the student with direct problems at the root instead of complications with the entire subject. So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused.",5
29cf025,"Why would we need technology to tell us someones emotions when we know ourselves? No, I don't think that this is valuable because it is basically a machine that does an action that we can do ourselves. It also may not even be as acurate as scientist beleive. Another reason why I beleive that this invention isn't valuable is because I just find it really scary how exact the numbers are that the machine gives even if the numbers aren't correct and how much of interaction is happening between the face and the software.

The first reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because we don't need a machine to do the job of reading expressions for us when we can do it just fine by ourselves. I know this because in the article they state,"" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."" This shows that we can indeed read emotions of people all by ourselves. I also know this because the text states,"" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This statement is completely true, I know that I can tell when people are upset even if they aren't my friends or someone that I know. Finally, I know this because the text states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" This is true to a point because we may not be able to know when someone is feeling worried or frustrated but we know that something is wrong. That is not a bad thing when we don't know every expression on somoenes face becasue that gives us social experiences with other people to go and ask them what's wrong.

The second reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because scientists may beleive that this technology is accurate but is it really? I know this because in the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This right here shows that if the muscles of the face aren't showing enough muscle for an emotion the software might pick up a different emotion. I also know this because the text states that, ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbiculars oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" I disagree with how they are training this software to recognize facial emotion because some people don't make a happy face when they are happy or a sad face when they are sad.

The last reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because it is really creepy on how exact the number can get and how much interaction there is between the computer and the face. I know this because the text states,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Wow, to me that is scary. I would never want this software to read my facial expressions. I also know this because the text states, "" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" Why would people want computers to take over little everyday things that we do? This is creepy how much computers have weasled their way into our everyday lives so easily.

In conclusion, I beleive that this software isn't valuable because why would we use a machine to do something that we can do by ourselves? Also because the information being received from the software may not even be accurate. Finally, because the software is just really creepy and scary to think about how much human and machine interaction happens daily and how much much we rely on them.     ",5
29d4a8c,"As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet. If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society.

It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' ""

The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.

When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of ""In the real world"" and "" Highschool is preparing you for the real world"". Later on in life, ""in the real world"", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.

The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.

The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.

I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.

People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want.

Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.   ",5
29daf40,"As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that ""All of our [the U.S.A.'s] development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress.

In the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with McDonalds' ""Super Size"" menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City's Manhattan, you won't see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expesive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it's made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it's not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". Plaza said that, ""It's [limiting car usage] a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new ""car-free"" suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a ""car-reduced"" community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people.

Bejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", that Paris, after suffering from ""five days of intensive smog"" called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twenty-two euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn't some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it's cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing.

Limiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their well-being, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, ""The End of Car Culture"", has ""ambitious goals to curb the Unites States' greenhouse gas emissions"". If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment.

Ever since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.       ?    ",5
2a7d71d,"Dear State Senator,

I believe that we should change the electoral college to election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral college is in no way fit to be the basis of how we choose the president of the United States. This country was based of of popular soverignty and we should keep it the way that it always has been with all the decison makeing done be the people.

The electoral college is an overwhemingly unfair system to voters. The canidents will not spend any of their time in states they know will not win because of the winner take all system in each state. they only focus on the tight races and some of the states dont even get to see the campaign ads. Some of the states did not even see the candidates at all. The electoral college is essentially one of the most unfair things in the prospect that the candidates dont spend time in the states that they dont think will win and the states that they know wont win are not even privillaged enough to see the campaign ads.

In addition to being unfair the electoral college can cause serious damage. The electoral college have the power to go against the will of the people. Back in the '60s segregationists in the Louisiana legislature were almost successful in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. Also during that time some electors would occasionally vote for whomever they please and not vote for their party's candidate. If the electoral college were to ever go into a tie it would be given to the House of Representatives. During this time the the states representatives will be cating thier votes on behalf of thier state. The problem with that is that those representatives are voting on behalf of thier entire state and that means they are voting for who they want and acting like that it is something the entire state wants.

There are five ""offical"" benifits of having the electoral college. The benifits are certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and you avoid run-off election. All of these things are in fact true but what if you are willing to risk all of that just to be able to be the one who has a say in who becomes president. I know that they kind of do but in reality that does not really mean much if there is someone who is going to completly disregard my vote and do whatever he feels like doing. I know that all of those five benifits are important but isnt my right to have a say in whose president important as well?

Senator, the reason for my letter is that I want to have a say in who the president is going to be and the electoral college resticts that. I believe that the president of the United States should be elected by popular vote because this is America and in America we do what the people want and the people want change. We want the electoral college out and popular vote in.

Sincerely,

A concerned citizen    ",5
2aa01a0,"A future with driverless cars can have many mixed feelings. Driverless cars could help solve many issues, but in the same way cause just as many problems. Many companies have been working on driverless cars now for years, but none have a definate answer to a car without any help and opperational needs by humans. Not having a fully driverless car already can represent the struggle, and challenge of creating a driverless car in this era. So i believe that the creation of a driverless car is a waste. They can be dangerous on the streets, cost lots of money, and have no real need in this day and age.

Driverless cars have already been proven to be dangerous on the streets. Companies have not yet come up with the technology for a car that can self-drive; the self-driving cars need a person on the wheel for emegergencies. Also, these cars can brake, steer and move on there own but need the assistance of a human when challenges come in the way. They need special help, and require the driver who is already at the wheel to take over and navigate through work zones and accidents. Having a ""driverless car"" but with a driver in the driver's seat, with his hands already on the wheel, but not driving makes it reduntant. Why waste that effort if a driver is already in the current position to drive.

If companies are putting all this effort into driverless cars, why cant they put the same effort and money into a real world issue? A nice, new car can cost a whole lot of money, and at a low can run upto 25,000 dollars. So a nice, new car that would drive itslef would run upto even much more money than that. We already have nice cars that we can drive oursleves around in, and with no problem at all. We shouldnt be focused on making cars that would make us Americans even lazier by not having to drive them. Companies should instead put this money to helping find the cure for cancer, or fighting against poverty and homelessness in America or other countires. Better things could be done with this money, instead of trying to make Americans even lazier.

A car that can drive itself has no real need in todays age, people drive themsleves fine everyday around the world without a problem. Some might say that having a driverless car is beneficial by having the car drive you somewhere, but then go back home for another family member to use. That isnt a real need, because almost everyone has a car nowadays anyway. Also, you need to have your hands on the sterring wheel while the car drives so its really not an option. What if the car didnt need your hands on the wheel while driving? Well say something harzardous did happen on its way home or a car crash, and the car needed to alert the driver to take over. The driver wouldnt be present, and the car would shut down and not make it to its destination.

Driverless cars are meant to sound fun, while having fun riding in one. Instead, they can infact be a waste of time, all in determination to find a new product for consumers to buy. They can even be a burden to opperate in; adults and young adults learn how to opperate and safely drive a car, but they would need a new curriculum to teach how to opperate a driverless car. They would need to show what to do during your ride in a driverless car versus what not to do. There is even the possiblilty of needing a different license, and test to be able to opperate a driverless car. So why go through all this hassel, and complexity for somwthing new, when we already have a fully functional car now that fullfils our needs.",5
2aa5a24,"The idea of Venus being worth of pursuit, depsite its dangers, isn't completely outrageous. The author of this passage dives into this idea, stating a reason as to why Venus exploration should happen, and also stating reasons that it currently isn't possible. Though the author does touch on the ideas of why we should explore this planet, they do not give enough reason to support the claim, or at least enough reason and ideas to keep the idea circulating within the brain of all of the readers.

The author seems to use at least two of their paragraphs to give why we should travel to Venus, in a sense that we were able to do so. In Paragraph 3 they describe the conditions of the planet, adding that Venus has volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes just as Earth does. This is just the start of the author's biggest and only claim, which fully arrives in Paragraph 4. The author does so by adding more physcial features of Venus and almost putting them side by side to Earth's. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."", and adding that ""...Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Later on, they also state that Venus has recognizable features, such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author wrote only about how scientists would learn the history of Venus, and gave no reasoning beyond this.

Though displaying a solid claim, the author gives no further explaination to their only reasoning, and goes straight into talking about the difficulty of traveling to the planet. There are multiple things the author could have slipped into the passage, like the abundance of information that scientists would learn, opening further travel, and the creation of new technology. Scientists and man alike would obtain much needed information from exploring Venus. Not only would going to this planet tell us its history, just as the author said, but it would push us closer to the exploration of planets that sit beyond this.

The author described a trip to Venus as being one that would be no fun for humans, but if able to create technology to keep our explorers safe, there would be smaller and fewer limits on the places our explorers and scientists could go after. By picking such a harsh planet to start one of many trips, the work and energy put into a way to reach the planet would pay off more than the world seems to understand. Though the technology used to get to Venus would have to be updated depending on the length of travel and the conditions of travel,--snowy and colder climates or hot, tretorous terrain like Venus--it is quite possible to get more out of Venus than what is displayed.

Readers do receive great information from this passage, but the author could have been equipt to know more reasons as to why studying Venus would be a great thing for scientists. They did give the wonderous and plentyful reasons as to why it will be harsh to reach and remain on the planet, however. Despite this all, Venus is a planet to reconcile with, even if it means waiting the months or years it takes to make just the technology compatable enough to work with its body. ",5
2ab0ffc,"""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"", quote from the excerpt ""The End of Car Culture"", explains that people in the United States have started to become less dependent on cars. Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportations that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.

Smog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasonline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a ""Car-free day"", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these ""Car-free days"" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a $31.00 or 22-euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This ""Car-free day"" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.

When people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. ""The streets of Vauban are completely ""car-free""- except the main thoroughfare"", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban's familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.

Cars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a car-shop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the car-shop would cost a least $100.00 out of pocket.

Limiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Car-free day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportations besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world.       ????       ?       ?????       ?    ",5
2ab69a7,"My position on driverless cars is that I am against it. Autonomous cars still need the driver to be focused on the road. The driver must always be ready to take control of the car in any situation. I feel like autonomous cars give a false sense of safety when it comes to driving one of these autonomous cars. The cars arent fully autonomous they still require the driver to have his hands on the wheel in case he has to overtake the controls.

One reason I am against it is because no road that we drive on is fully predictable, so the cars wont know what to do when some situations arise. Most people who buy autonomous cars think they dont have to focus on the road and just leave it all to the car. Thats false, thats what makes these cars dangerous in a sense. "" The can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill,"" this is the reason I am against it. There may be a time that the driver needs to take over and steer the car out of danger, but since the driver had a false sense of security, he/she wont have time to react. They wouldnt have time to react because they might've been doing something else in the driver seat thinking that the car will steer itself. This is why drivers should always be in full control of the car at all times, because no road is predictable and it requires fast human skills if any situation arises.

There might be safety precautions that can try to prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. This wont help at all in my opinion. Since the driver isnt doing anything, they will feel tired and bored and close their eyes and sleep. If they're really tired they wont hear the warning signs about work zones or any other warning in that matter. Everyone is different, some people are light sleepers and others are heavy. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" This will fail in some occasions. Say you're a heavy sleeper, and you dont feel the vibrations, and you crash into an object. Will that be your fault or the manufactorers fault for giving you a false sense of safety? Does the vibration have a setting to make it vibrate violently to wake the driver up? Does the vibration start happening at different distances depending on the speed of the car? Also how does one know the reaction time of a driver? These are the test they need to do to know how to make these cars safer. The reaction time of a person woken up from sleep is really slow compared to someone who is fully awake. Also how does the car recognize that a danger is going to happen.

In conclusion this is why I think autonomous cars is not good for the people. Its not safe for the driver who is moving at high speeds down the highway with a false sense of safety. Its not safe for pedestrians who cross streets not knowing if a human is controlling the car or not. Streets will never be predictable and the computers on the car will go off of predictability. Yes there will always be a traffic hazard everywhere you go, and the car might not know what to do and its up to you to get yourself and the car out of harms way. This wont happen if you're asleep at the wheel thinking the car will do it itself and you wont have to do a thing. I feel like if a person is wanting to buy a autonomous car, they will have to take courses on how to correctly use the controls and also what to do when theres an emergency ahead. They will have to know the fundimental things like dont fall asleep on the wheel, always be focused and looking for potentional hazards ahead. Always put your hands on the wheel whenever the car tells you to. Also the main thing they should focus on is to never trust the car to get you from one place to another without your assistance along the way. Thats why in think autonomous cars a negative thing.                    ",5
2aca278,"One big milestone in a person's teenage years is when they have to take a driver's test to get their license. Many people often become stressed behind the wheel during the driver's test because they are afraid of making mistakes. The people of our generation are just as nervous about these test as our older generations but what if that were to change in the future? What if, instead of driving cars where we have to be driving one hundred percent of the time, there were cars out there that allowed the car to do the driving for us? Many companies have been working on the idea of ""driverless cars"" in hopes that they will reshape the whole concept of driving. However, that does not mean they are a good thing. Driverless cars should not be used in the future because they could take away the focus of the driver, the future generation wouldn't know about driving basics, and they are illegal in some states.

First of all, they could take away the focus of some drivers. As these driverless cars are being invented, they allow drivers to meerly sit back in the drivers seat and enjoy the road. Sitting for thirty minutes in a car will not be enough to satisfy the boredom of some people. There are people out there who can not deal with sitting in one place for a few minutes and have to do something to keep them busy. Therefore, their focus could easily move to something else other than the road, like a fellow passenger or at the scenery around them. Driverless cars are not entirely driverless. As said in the article, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" What if the driver is not prepared to take over when the situation requires? These new cars may have features of notifying an individual when they need to take over but if they are not ready because they were focused on something else, then the results could be disastirous. This is why it takes away focus from drivers.

Next, the future generation would not know about driving basics. Many teenagers today have to take drivers ed classes as they attempt to obtain a license from the BMV. But what would future generation drivers have to go through for their driving exams if we have driverless cars. As stated before, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. The newer generations still have to learn to basics of driving even if they will be driving in a driverless car in the future. If this does not happen, then they could be in trouble if their driverless cars malfunction or they are forced to drive a regular car instead. The future generations will probably not know about the driving basics because they will think they are too far advanced for it. For example, not many people know how to drive ""stick"" or even know what that means even though it was vital for driving long ago. If someone were to enter a car that needed that kind of function, they would not know what to do. And the same thing applies to future generations if they would not know the driving basics.

Finally, these vehicles are against the law in some states. According to the article, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control ata all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" With the government concerned about the safety of a driver behind the wheel, they will not allow driverless cars on the roads. The safety of the people is more important than to advancement of technology. Until the driverless cars have been updated to the time where they are safe for everyone, there is no way that driverless cars will be seen on the roads with regular cars for quite some time. This is why driverless vehicles are against the law in some states.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be used in the future because they take away the driver's focus, the future generations need to learn about the driving basics that we use today, and it is illegal to use computer-driven cars. Of course, in the future, new technology will arise to give people more mobility and ways of transportation but that will not happen until everyone is safe. Many individuals are in car crashes every year from lack of focus on the road. Driverless cars can add to this problem just like any other and until we have to tools necessary to ensure they safety of the people using driverless cars, there is no way that they will be seen among the streets.

2af44aa,"The Debate of the Faces

A new technology called Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to show human emotions by facial expressions, is not valuable to students in the classroom. I do not think that a computer system to read the emotions of students is needed for a quality education. Students have been learning in schools without the Facial Action Coding System for hundreds of years, so why would the Facial Action Coding System help us now? The Facial Action Coding System could actually be unbeneficial to students in the long run. This system could make students feel uncomfortable and insecure about their learning.

The main reason that the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom is beause it is invading to the students privacy. The students may feel like their emotions are invaded by a computer that is constantly watching them. The Facial Action Coding System could make the student feel like they are being pressured and that their emotions for a certain day can alter their learning style. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements?in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"" (D'Alto). This shows that the system can watch the students' every move. Would you like to be watched all day by a computer that is reading your mood?

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is not needed in the classroom is because many classes in school are taught by a teacher, not by computers. The Facial Action Coding System might not be used at all if the school is taught by a majority of teachers, which could be a waste of money and software. Dr. Huang says in paragraph 6 that 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Even though this statement is true about the Facial Action Coding System, many lessons in schools are not taught by computers, but are taught by teachers. The teacher could also probably tell if the students are bored or confused so they could alter their lessons. In paragraph 5, the author says that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ?calculation? every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto). This shows that the classroom teacher could effectively alter their lesson based on the expressions of the students, just as the Facial Action Coding System could.

In some cases the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to the classroom and learning environment. If a student is taking online courses or a school is predominantly taught by computer lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would help students stay more focused. The system could try to change the way of teaching based on the viewer's expressions. The system can also be beneficial to ads on computers. ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto). This shows that the Facial Action Coding System could also make ads more interesting for those on computers often.

The Facial Action Coding System is definetly an amazing invention to computers and reading facial expressions. Although it is a great invention, I do not think that schools are ready for a program that studies the students' faces. This technology should not be used so it can protect the students' privacy, make them feel comfortable in the learning environment, and make them feel like their lessons are not forced. Many schools are also probably still taught by a majority of teachers, whearas the Facial Action Coding System would not be needed at all. All in all, it depends on where you fall in the debate of the faces.",5
2b14412,"Dear Senator,

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(Office of the Federal Register1). Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process.

In Richard Posner's, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winner-take-all basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 perecnt of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state"" (Posner 1). With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the canidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not aknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College alllows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" (The Office of the Federal Register 1). This adds suppprt that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a sucessful one.

In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the canidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election""(Posner 1).? Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer 1). The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, "" Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" (Plumerr 1). This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Posner 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?       ?

2b1c1bf,"Cars, the pride and joy of many people. They may look nice and go fast, but they hurt the environment more than most people would know. If Americans in certain places used public transit or walked, air pollution would go down by 50% in those areas. It would be better for the environment, and for the human body's health to reduce the amount they drive in their personal car.

To begin, cars are the second most cause of air pollution in the United States behind power plants. Since the end of World War II the U.S.A has been idolizing cars, and they have been focusing on the production of these cars. In Vauban, Germany there is a ratio of 3 to 10 people who own cars. Only 30% of the population owns a car, which is saving the air from quite a bit of pollution. Another event that will help lower pollution would be banning driving cars for a day or two. In Paris, there was so much smog that it was compared and even rivaled Beijing, China; which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The people who drove their cars on this day would be fined $31 American dollars. The public transit was free of charge because it was being promoted to use, as it helps the air become less polluted. This event also happened in three Colombian cities, Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar. The ban on the cars made many people seem to be happier, and more energetic. This ban has been happening for three years now in Bogota, and other Latin American cities are now seeing the importance of it. The use of bicycles, the public transit, or even walking helps reduce air pollution in your city.

In addition to not using personal cars, walking from jobs or to the mall has seemed to make many people in these driving bans less stressful and much happier. From government officials to the commonfolk of the street, all of the Colombians in Bogota look much happier. Even rain hasn't stopped them from biking to work. One woman in Vauban, Heidrun Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She does not own a car and lives a happy life. She even sold her car to move here, along with 57% of other families who live in the town. Not only does the relaxation of not driving make you less stressful, it also makes you get more excersize. Since 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, we can assume that they are one of the healthiest cities in Germany or even the world. If all cities in Europe were nearly identical to Vauban then they would have only 3% greenhouse gas emissions from cars, but they would also have a much lower rate of obesity. Even in some parts of the United States, car emissions would go down by 50% which would, in turn, cause obesity to go down by a gigantic number as well. The use of bicycles and your feet would greatly reduce obesity along with increasing happiness.

Although some people may argue that people who don't own personal cars will use public transit instead and societies without personal cars will not have a decreased obesity. This may be true, but if people use public transit then they are helping the environment even more than themselves. They would still have to walk to and from the bus stops. Which will decrease obesity although it may not be in as big of numbers as we would like.

In conclusion the absence of personal automobiles would greatly reduce the air pollution in most major cities. Beijing could become it's once beautiful city, and Paris wouldn't have to ban driving because of thickened smog. The United States would also never have problems with smog, and we would also reduce air pollution by 50%. Communities like Vauban and Bogota are prime examples of people who do not need cars to survive. They are stress free, and much happier than most car driven societies. Personal cars do much more harm, than good. This is why we do not need to rely on the use of personal cars.    ",5
2b743c0,"Driverless cars are the future of safety while driving across the world. These cars have the technology to predict and protect against complex life-threatening issues that a human does not possess the power to handle themselves. Although the change to semi-driverless or driverless cars may be expensive; it is a change that can change the future of driving on roads for the better.

An issue that comes with having fully human controlled vehicles is not all cars have safety measures that the driver can control, such as sensors in the brakes. These sensors contain information that the human driving could not possess alone, showing that we need driverless cars to help make the upcoming generation of drivers more protected on the dangerous roads. In paragraph five the author states: ""antilock brakes can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone,"" which shows the true power of these sensors inside of driverless cars. Legalizing driverless cars can bring the power of antilock brakes to every car in the world which would drastically reduce the amount of accidents related to skidding on ice or flipping cars.

One of the reasons that these driverless cars are not legalized in all states is as of right now traffic laws are under the assumption that ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times,"" as the author states in paragraph nine. Although these cars are not driven by humans one hundred percent of the time, they can still be taken over by humans whenever a situation such as an accident in the middle of the road needs to be navigated around, this is proven in the seventh paragraph. In paragraph seven the author says: ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate whenever a vehicle is in danger of backing into an object,"" and ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over,"" proving that when the driver is in danger, the driver can take over the controls. These innovations heighten the safety of the driver in one of these vehicles.

Driverless cars and sensors aren't anything new to the roads, either. In paragraph three the author states that General Motors has been working on driverless cars since the late 1950s. As technology rapidly advances the sensors and computer needed to make driverless cars can become less expensive and more powerful. In only ten years advancements such as antilock brakes and the ability to drive seventy-five percent of the time have surfaced, and there are many more advancements to come. The first generation of driverless cars are expected throughout 2016-2020, with many more generations and advancements to improve upon the original models.

In 1980, the dream of having a fully autonomous vehicle would be something to see in a science-fiction magazine. Little did the people know that these cars would be available in only 36-40 years away and could dramatically increase safety on roads. Driverless cars provide heightened safety for the next generations of drivers and should not be taken as something small. Now that the technology is here to stay we need to be able to put it to proper use. Driverless cars have many generations to come and more safety to benefit the future generation of drivers.   ",5
2b7e769,"Once again, it appears that people are glorifying the machine again and exalting it to a dominant position over society and humankind itself. Once again, people put quantity over quality, believing that something as complex and immaterial as human emotion can be quantified into a data set of integers and percentages.

This worship of machine, and the unjustified extension of its jurisdiction into domains it has no place whatsoever meddling with, finds itself expressed again in the recent technological concoction that is the ""Facial Action Coding System,"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, engineered and realized by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois and his colleagues. With this FACS, they believe that one's emotions can be easily identified and laid down on a neat percentage-based chart of X-percent this, Y-percent that. This technology, they believe, can be used in classrooms, as a means of ensuring a student's perpetual engagement in the lesson via improvisation of the lesson based on whatever calculations are made.

However, does one need to make a particular face to be bored, or confused? There are some faces we might make most of the time, possible some of us who make them all the time when losing interest or encountering confusion--however, that may not be so for all of us. There may be those whose faces might say, ""I understand the lesson,"" but their souls say ""What in the world is this?"" Similarly, their faces might say, ""I am intrigued by this,"" while within their hearts in reality, they are waiting for that relieving ring of the lunch bell to come upon their eardrums.

The human face is not a good indicator for emotion--if one wishes to be somewhat poetic, one could say that the human face is ""two-faced;"" It could tell you one emotion while hiding and masquerading another. One's face can be stern and mean-looking, while in fact underneath it lies the feeling of great satisfaction or relaxation. One's face can be happy and smiling (a physically genuine smile, too), maybe even laughing, while masquerading behind it, for some conscious or unconscious purpose, is a sorrowful melancholy that could wring tears from a stone.

In contrast to the thought behind this technology's premise, which claims that the human heart's imprints on the face can be ""classified [in to] six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3) I claim that human emotion can not be quantified. No one can rely upon the face to know the heart, just like no one can rely upon reason solely to know the Universe and the powers and Power beyond it. This technology should not be used in classrooms, or in fact anywhere really, for due to its erroneous foundation, there are bound to be erroneous results; not mere outliers, but I would say a significant chunk and portion of facial assessments. I am against the ""value"" of this technology being used to read students' emotions--for I am against this technology being used anywhere, and the false material-minded thinking which is its, and modernity's in general, foundational philosophy.",5
2b89aad,"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. How well does this author truly show this? He shows how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, it's often reffered to as earth's twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks.

People from earth can see Venus just by looking up at the right place. The author states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" So from afar we can see it as a big ""light"" in the sky, kind of like a star. But Venus is not a star it is a planet. What he means by this is that you can see how bright Venus is from afar but what you can't see what it is really like close up. But if we dont know what Venus is like close up then how do we know it is Earth's ""twin""?

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". According to the text ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the clostest distance too."" The passage also states, ""Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" So if Venus is so much like earth then why can't we send a spacecraft to Venus now? Well we tried and it didnt workout. There was a spacecraft sent unmanned because the spacecraft could only survive the landing for three hours. Venus today still have some features that are close to ours on earth. Could this mean it could become safe sometime? Doubtful. According to the passage, ""Venus is a planet that has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters."" So why do we need to get so up close to Venus even though it causes risks?

Wouldn't you like to know whats on Venus even if it could be dangerous? I beileve this is why the author suggest thst Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it precents. You may wonder what thoes dangers are. According to the passage, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" So why should we still go? NASA is finding a possible solution to the hostile conditions. According to the text ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hoveriing 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground confitions by staying up and out of their way."" It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means we would be able to see and get more information about Venus.

I conclude that because of all the new findings that this is why the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers. If Venus is like Earth does that mean that what happened to Venus might happen to us? This is why we need more information. The author shows us how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, its often reffered to as earths twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks. These are very important to know when deciding weather it is a good idea to travel to Venus even with the dangers. ",5
2b98752,"The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of? popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indfensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game chnager on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college? represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.    ",5
2ca50cd,"The future is full of new and exciting technologies, including the ""driverless car"". The idea of a car that can drive itself is exciting, but also very dangerous. Although there are precautions the companys have taken to prevent accidents, something could always happen, and no company has found the answer to who is at fault if there is an accident.

Driverless cars may seem like an exciting new way to travel, but there is not a way for the driver to completely relax. The driverless cars cannot drive where there is not a smooth course. If there is construction work or an accident the car can not drive, and requires the skills of a human, which makes the name ""driverless car"" falsely stated. The way the cars alert the driver that their assitance is needed, is just by annoucing that the driver needs to take over. This way of getting the driver's attention may not always end in success if the driver is distracted and not paying attention to the car or the road.

Why not have a human drive instead? The driver has to always be alert and ready to take over in a driverless car, so why not just drive normally? It does not make sense for a driver to sit in a car and wait until they have to take over and drive, and that drive may only take five minutes. It is pointless to have a computer drive and to have the person in the driver's seat be alert.

Driverless cars are also making it ""fun"" to drive in a car where a person is not needed nighty percent of the time. Some manufacturers are planning to bring in car entertainment systems, which is another distraction to drivers on the road. Also, not needing to drive gives people more opportunites to be on their cellphones, read road signs, or look at the scenary instead of the road. All of these distractions are giving drivers more reasons to not pay attention to the road, and will prevent them from taking over the car when the computer can no longer drive.

Driverless cars are dangerous, but they do bring some goods to the table. Driverless cars are estimated to only use half of the fuel that regular cars use today, which can help the environment immensely. They are a new and exciting way to travel and get around, and if all the drivers are paying attention, can prevent accidents because of the sensors and cameras.

Driverless cars are exciting, but they are dangerous and have never been tested in real situations, like a family going on vaction, or someone going to work. The outcomes are unknown, something can always go wrong, and no manufacturers know who will be blamed when something does go wrong. The cons outweigh the pros, driverless cars are dangerous and cannot be trusted to handle situations if a driver is not paying attention. Driverless cars should not be developed and sold. ",5
2cfa990,"Dear state senator,

Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" (What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register) In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state; therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" (In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner) So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer) This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states."" (In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner) It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and well-aware of our candidates? ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer) Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be well-informed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore. Thank you for taking the time to consider my letter.

Sincerely,

Concerned Citizen    ",5
2d356a1,"The ""Evening Star"" as the author from ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is another name for venus. Venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so. The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.

A point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, ""Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters"" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus ""Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said ""just like Earth"" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.

Furthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial ""occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus"" (Exploring Venus). The author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph. The author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Exploring Venus). This is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins. So when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration.

How do we finally explore Venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus. One way that NASA can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (Exploring Venus). This is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to Venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past. Another way NASA could send astronauts to venus is through a giant Blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus ""A Blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape"" (Exploring Venus). a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs. ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal"" (Exploring Venus). This is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore Venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose.

In concluison Venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the Planet is also worth exploring. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" insist that going to Venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there, the author presents this claim by explaining that, it is similar to Earth so we can learn about our planet as well as Venus. Also Venus is close so this can save time traveling to it and that we have to overcome challenges to get their but it is ultimately worth going.",5
2d39dbb,"The author shows a lot of support for the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers in a multitude of ways some of which include interesting facts, to ways how it could be done. He even tells us in the first paragraph saying ""it has proved a very challanging place to examine more closely."" so it is not very easy to do but it is possibe.

The author even talks about how humans have already sent numerous space craft to venus in paragraph two ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" and just a sentence after that it tells us ""numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challanging planet for humans to study, despite its proxmity to us."" so the author tells that us despite the issue of how dangerous it is to land there, it still tells us as readers that we are still studying it despite how much of a challange it is, and just because we are close to it doesn't make it any easier to study.

In paragraph four he starts telling us why its worthy, despite how hard it is to study by saying ""astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like plane in our solar system."" and then continues on to say ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" so he is implying that benefits of studying Venus would be that we would be able to see if there were other life forms on the planet in the past, and that we would be able to find out what happened to the past earth like planet. The author also keeps telling us that Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit, so that it would be cheaper to get there and we could try to study it more without spending too much despite the dangers. Cheaper then its counterpart Mars at least. He even tells us of some ways that NASA has ideas for sending humans to Venus so that we would be able to study it without that much effort despite the dangers.

The author even supports his claim in paragraph eight by saying ""Striving to meet the challange presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" by saying that he tells us some of the benefits like how studying the planet has value, but he also tells us that we will likely be studying other dangerous planets and that this is just one of the many we will be studying so doing this one is no different and that it would be well worth the challange, but also the insights we would earn from the planet itself. In the next sentence he tell us that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" the author is telling us that we should not be scared of the dangers and doubts, but that we should improve upon ourselves and shove ourselves to the edge of imagination and innovation, despite the dangers and that it is well worth the risk.",5
2d6ecf2,"Learning and curiosity are what keep the human race moving foward and contiually evolving. Through this, humans created the ultimate technology, the computer. Computers help with almost everything humans do in their lives, and now there is technology that can decipher the most untouched part of humans, emotions. The technology called FACS (Facial Action Cofing System), can figure out what a person is feeling and do many things with that information. This technology would be valuble because it would help inmprove the quality of learning in the classroom. I believe this because it can help bring back the attention of bored students, figure out problems with students, and figure out the most beneficial way for each student to learn.

First of all, this technology could keep students engaged in their learning experience. Most students drift off during class because the material they are being taught isn't being taught in an interesting way. In paragraph 6, the text states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."" This shows that a computer could easily recognize when a student becomes uninterested in the lesson they're being taught and what that lesson is about. Being able to discover when a student has become disengaged with their learning could help teachers turn the attention of that student back to what they were supposed to be learning.

Another reason allowing this technology to read student's emotions would be beneficial is because computers would be able to understand more than just verbal human communitation. According the the text, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.'"" Computers are so ingraned in daily life that almost everything that people do involves some type of technology. If they were able to read the emotions of students, teachers could catch problems before they even happened. For example, if a student was becoming depressed, they might not reach out to anyone for help, but a computer could recognize the constant sadness on the students face and contact someone who could help resolve the situation. That is just part of the reason that this technology, which could read students emotions, is extremely valuble.

Finally, this technology could be helpful in the classroom by learning, by it's self, the specialized interests of each specific student. If a student was more interested in one learning style than another, the computer could recognize the facial cues of the student and ajust properly. The text states, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" That could be easily modified to fit into the classroom. Instead of ads, the computer could display a certain type of learning, such as flashcards. If the student enjoyed using flashcards, then the computer could remember that and display flashcards as the initial method of learning in the future. However, if another student was shown flashcards as a learning method and the computer recognized facial cues that showed dislike or disinterest, it could change the learning method to something else, like matching. By reading the emotions of students in the classroom, a computer could figure out the most beneficial way for a student to learn.

In conclusion, this technology has so many potential benefits if it were to be used in the classroom. It can help bring back the attention of bored students, figure out problems with students, and figure out the most beneficial way for each student to learn. Teachers would finally be able to get students interested in learning again instead of having kids dread waking up in the morning because it's time for another day of the same old thing. Having computers in the classroom that can read the emotions of students in the classroom could reignite a passion for leaning that many kids lost the moment they walk in the classroom door.",5
2d9dbe2,"How well something is said and in what way it is said to the audience plays a role in how the big or small the impact is; Depending on how well written something is makes a difference as well. In a passage called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives an excellent essay on why traveling to Venus is a worthwhile journey.

For example, the author states, at one time Venus is believed to have been the closest resimbled to Earth. In paragraph 4, the text states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supportes various forms of life, just like Earth."" The planet has a rocky surfaces and also has features such as valleys, mountains and craters. The author states,""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable.."" This proves that the author presents relatable evidnece that the journey to Venus is a worthwhile trip.

The author gives NASA as an example of the information that is provided in the passage. In paragraph 7, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus..."" The author states that NASA is working on using a device like a modern computer. The paragraph also states how there are problems with NASA's idea as well. The author gives an acurate example to help the reader picture what it would be like. This proves that the author can give evidence that supports the overall claim.

On the contray, the author gives more background information than what good could come from studying Venus. The author states all the information that desscribes the atomosphere and what the surface of Venus is like but gives very little information that concerns the reason why Venus should be explored. However, without the background information about Venus's surfaces and atmosphere it may not be understood as to why the journey to Venus is such a trouble. The author provides information that can help understand the reason that astronomers should study Venus.

In conclusion, the author does well at supporting the idea that the trip to Venus is worth taking. The author states information that is from reliable sources, such as NASA. This proves that the author has a well supported idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit even thorugh the dangers that are going to be faced. The author provides a wide variety of reliable information that supports his claim allowing for a strong claim. The author gave a well written essay that can appeal to all people and change their mind to see in the way of the author's claim.",5
2db6925,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that the exploration of Venus is worth its risks. In the article, they state that it would be worth investigating because there is a potential that humans could survive there, but not without its challenges. The author provides a fair amount of evidence that states Venus could be an issue to gather information about. Overall, the author provides a contradicting article and is somewhat difficult to understand what side he supports, exploring Venus or to not.

The author provides reasons that Venus should actually be looked into. The reasons the author provides are: the geographical conditions on Venus used to be similar to what Earth has today, that the planet is the closest planet to ours, and could have at one point, ""...supported various forms of life, analogous to those on Earth."" The author doesn't provide a lot of evidence for any of these reasons other than the types of geographical features that are similar between Earth and Venus. The author does, however, provide technology-related solutions to the problems relating to how we could explore Venus. The author provides blimp-like, manned vehicles that could get within 30 miles or so above the planet. The author also provides simplified electronics made of a material known as, silicon carbide that could survive three weeks in the conditions that Venus has. The author then concludes his reasoning with how, ""... human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This simply means that we're just as likely to do something as risky and fear-inducing as exploring Venus and that we shouldn't be imaginatively contained because there are dangers that could possibly limit our expansion.

While the author has some reasons supporting the exploration of Venus, they have provided many challenges NASA, or any other space program, would have to overcome and downfalls to the planet. The author provides reasons such as: no aeronautic vehicle has been able to survive the landing for more than a few hours, the planet's atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth's (800 degrees Farenheit), the pressure on the surface is enough to crush a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans, and how our use of modern computers would be limited due to the extreme physical conditions that they would have to withstand. The author provides an abundance of, somewhat, overwhelming reason that we shouldn't continue to proceed exploration of Venus.

While the author provides some good reasons to explore Venus and what it contains, they also happened to contradict almost every reason with why it would be a bad idea to pursue it, which is fairly counter-intuitive. The author perhaps meant to give these reasons to warn us and for us to bear the information of how it could go wrong, or how it would be a struggle and then come to terms with the idea that it would still be a good idea to explore Venus. But again, its also comprehended that the author themself doesn't want us to explore the planet. I feel that the author clearly portrayed the distaste that the exploration could bring and less clearly of why and how it would be a good idea.",5
2e128b5,"Driverless cars, also known as autonomous cars are dreams from the future. We have all seen them in movies. Today's innovations are begining to make autonomous cars a tangible concept. In fact,they are already being designed. Driverless cars have been imagined since the General Motor's concept car. The first autonomous cars were driven by radio signals and magnets, but these things proved to be too impractical. The development of futuristic cars are a contraversial topic. I believe that driverless cars should be developed because they are gas-efficient, time-saving, and safer

Driverless cars save time. During the time spent driving, someone could be doing their homework, or reading a book. Drivers can continue their daily life by drinking morning coffee or eating breakfast. Drivers would not need to be alert and focused on the street when their attention could be better used elsewhere. Instead of the time spent driving they could manage their time. For example, on a roadtrip, the mom could be preparing dinner instead of driving. Instead of driving an EMT could already be working on an inured person. This time would allow faster medical attention and save lives. These concepts are entirely possible with future innovations. However, is still room for improvement. Cars still require human assistance to navigate through tricky areas. GM vibrates the seat and Google simply announces it.

Which brings us to our next topic, gas. Gas is an unrenewable resource, meaning once it is depleted, it is gone forever. Sergey Brin says that the new driverless car will use half of the fuel of a modern day taxi. These cars could change the world. If we consume less fuel, as a result, the fuel will last longer. This will also reduce emissions and pollution. With pollution reduced, the effects of global warming will also be reduced, preserving endangered animals. Autonomous cars would allow for time for scientists to search for a new sources of fuel. Driverless cars are also more flexible than buses.

Some people may argue that driverless cars are dangerous. If the car were to malfunction and the passenger is unable to assist, it could result in a crash. The liability is huge, for on whom would the blame be placed? Once a perfected model of a driverless car emerges, this danger is eliminated. Many accidents are made while the driver is texting, or under the influence. Many driver's get distracted. With autonomous cars, these factors do not matter. The car will safely navigate you to your destination no matter what you are doing. Automatic functions have already prevented numerous accidents. Antilock breaks detect danger and prevent uncontrollable skids or rollovers.

Maps, sensors, computers, and radars, are Innovations we did not have in 2000. At the rate we are learning and inventing new things, driverlesscars will be here in no time. BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" can already steer, accelerate,and brake themselves. I support the development of autonomous cars, because they are time-saving, pollution-reducing, and safer.",5
2e78299,"Should the world create new driverless cars? The world needs something new I think, I am for the development of these cars.

Why do I agree with the development of these cars? The world has been driving cars for more than 100 years, and I think the it's time for something new, the world is moving at a rapid speed of new and advanced materials, such as our technology, we need to develope these cars because the world would be up to date to where it has to be. There are a couple reasons why I think these cars should be made!

It's a new way of traveling and a new of seeing how the world can coast off this invention. Think about it, everyone has either talked about wanting to have flying cars or driverless cars, we can't get there if we don't try, from where the world is at right now, it is time for a new spice in the cabinet.

If these cars are developed it would only take up half of the gas a regular taxi would usually use, that's less pollution and that would help out the world itself drastically. Sensors are on the cars, that gives the car a idea of its surroundings and know where to go. Anti lock brakes are there and are always on because just in case of emrgency.

At the same time, there are its cons, such as if you were to get injured or to get in a wreck, who is to blame, the car company or the person in the car? If we did end up making these cars, these laws have to be established so everyone knows just in case if they were in an accident. Also, why would we want a car

that still may need human assistance if it's suppose to be a driverless car? That doesn't sound like the american dream, I mean it's getting closer but it's not where we want to be. Us humans can't relax when we get in the car if the car still or may needs assistance from time to time, we might as well just drive our cars if it still needs us to drive from time to time. We shouldn't be in a hurry if we still can't have a legit driverless car, if we need time, take the take time, I think the world would rather have a car to where the driver has to absolutely nothing, and can sit back and relax 10 years from now, then to have a car to where the car drives 75% of the time and you drive the other 25% next month.

I agree that these types of cars should be made but lets not rush, lets get it perfect to where the world technically not have to drive. Like the article said in paragraph 10, ""The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" The American dream is coming, you just got to make it when the time is right, the technology is there, and the people are needing it the most.",5
2e95e4d,"Since remotely times, the man?had look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well as?someone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars; which it actually result to be a doble sided blade?contaminating with smog.

In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitants blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand,?Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt; the suburbian comunity has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a car?because they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectly?without cars, then they are not that necesary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside; most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogot│, Colombia where once a year people take a car-free day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting car-pooling!

But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives ?you to the bus station and then take the bus; a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job (if you live in Homestead and work in Miami). That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row; that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable (and it is still a lot!). If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something (which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral) you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need.

Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed than?the average person?who?owns a car;?people starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have; cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels.?Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars; can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogot│ or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there (just one bus). Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style.    ",5
2ed047c,"Some think that driverless cars are in our future. Others think that driverless cars are, and should stay, merely a product of science fiction. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea for several reasons. The first and most obvious reason is safety. A second reason is the large cost of manufacturing these cars. And finally, a third reason we do not need driverless cars in this day and age, is people would forget how to drive a regular car or neglect to even learn if the car drove itself.

The first reason that society does not need driverless cars is safety. Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors. However, some of these problems are easy to prevent now. It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The simple solution is not to do it. Most crashes caused from simple driving mistakes could be prevented as well. The problem is the driver, not the car. In addition, driverless cars would be at an increased risk for technolgical malfunctions causing potentially fatal crashes. As of right now, the technology in driverless cars is only experimental and theoretical. It would take many years to iron out all the bugs, so to speak, to make these cars function properly all the time. As mentioned paragrpah nine of the article, in most of the Unites States, it is illegal to test drive driverless cars. It is illegal for these very reasons. It is illegal because experimenting with that kind of technology is dangerous.

A second reason that driverless cars are not necessary is the unimaginable cost it would be to manufacture these cars. In addition, millions of dollars would be spent first to research and perfect the workings of the driverless cars. Not to mention, driverless cars would probably cost a larger sum of money than regular cars because of the time and cost of manufacturing them. In the past few years, in the United States has been going through a financial crisis. While our economy is now doing better, where would the money to fund these cars come from? In the article, the author mentions building smarter roads for cars. If that was the case, it would cost even more to fund this grand scheme. So much money is spent on paving and repairing roads every year, it would cost so much more to have to change or rebuild all of the roads in the country. In addition, if cars were to drive themselves, many laws would have to be changed for the new cars. Right now in the United States, one in five children will go hungry, there are clearly more important things to spend money on right now than to fund driverless cars.

A third and final reason that we do not need driverless cars is if we did, people would forget how to drive a regular car, or neglect to even learn. The article mentions that cameras might be needed to ensure people pay attention to the road. There are already enough distractions for drivers to worry about. Texting and driving has become a major issue in recent years. Imagine how easy it would be to be distracted by a phone or other device if the car you were in were driving itself? This is a slippery slope. It starts out with relatively small things, such as not paying full attantion to the road if the car drove itself. But soon, if people did not have to worry about traffic laws and safety, then they would soon forget them. Hypothetically speaking, what if someone who had been driving a driverless for a period of time one day had to go back to driving a regular one. This person may still have their liscense, but would they be able to pass a test for it now? Problems like this would make the road more dangerous than it already is. In addition, that same person who is now driving a regular car, may forget that he or she is controlling the car, being that they were so used to the car driving itself. There is enough reckless driving, that we do not nead people operating vehicles with no memory of how to do it! Or people might even neglect to learn how to drive a regular car at all if they depended on a driverless car all the time. If society allowed this to happen, the results could be catastrophic.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.      ",5
2f095a0,"The electoral college is a very controversial topic.? It has been debated by important figures like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole (Plumer).? While some people agree with Bradford Plumer and say that we should abolish this method, others stand behind Richard A. Posner, wanting to keep the electoral college.? Although the electoral college restores some of the weight in larger states, it is a very unfair method for voting on our president.? The electoral college allows someone to win the presidency who did not win the popular vote, and, if a tie occurs, the outcome is demeaning to larger states.

The electoral college does have a favorable trait.? It restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution (Posner). The senate only appoints 2 representatives per state, no matter how large their populations are.? The electoral college gets rid of this problem, assigning representitives to states based on population.

While that aspect of the electoral college is beneficial, it may be the only thing.? The electoral college is an extremely unfair method.? Just take the 2000 election, for instance.? Al gore won the popular vote but, thanks to this flawed method of selecting our president, lost the presidency (Plumer).? This was uncalled for.? If someone wins the popular vote and is wanted as president by the majority of people, then they should be president.? Our president is a position of the utmost importance.? We should have a leader that the majority of the people want.

Not only is the actual process unfair, but if there ever happens to be a tie it's even worse.? In the event of a tie in the electoral vote, the election is passed on to the House of Representatives, who then have the state delegations vote on the president (Plumer).? However, the catch is that each state gets only one vote (Plumer).? This means that the single represenative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters (Plumer).? This process is extremely unequal and should not be allowed.? Everyone should be able to have equal representation and play a part in critical decisions like this one.

All in all, the electoral college is unfair and people despise it.? According to a poll in 2000, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (Plumer).? The electoral college, while it may restore some of the weight in larger states, is detested all across the United States.? The person with the popular vote doesn't always win, and, in the event of a tie, the process is even more unfair than the actual method itself. The electoral college is an awful process that the majority of people don't want.? So why is it still here?       ?    ",5
3015118,"Since the finding of the face on Mars in 1976 many people have been saying that it must have been made from aliens on Mars. However this is not true. If there was life on Mars NASA would have found it by now because it would benefit them. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Pg 5) So therefor the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because of the amount of pictures taken of Mars and the face, the amount of time taken to research the Face and all of the NASA people saying it resembles natural landforms that are on Earth.

First off we know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because of all the pictures that were taken. If there was any alien life of any kind on Mars, NASA would have caught it. In the article it says, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" (Pg 10) The author of the article went into even more detail and said, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplans on the ground or Egytian- style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'""(pg 11) This explains how good the camera quality is and how they wouldn't be able to miss anything.

Including the amount of picture evidence against life on Mars and the fact that the Face was not made by extraterrestrials, the amount of time spent researching the face by NASA clearly shows they know what they're talking about. The first picture of the face was taken in 1976 and then it was a major hit and they took another picture 12 years later in 1998. Then again after that in 2001. Also in the article it says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"" (pg 7) This quote from the article shows to what extent NASA researchers went to to find out more about the Face.

As if there is not already a bunch of reasons why the face on Mars is just a landform, a group of people are agreeing with NASA's decision that the face is just a natural landform. According to the article it says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" (Pg 2) Also stated in the article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivelant of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho,' says Garvin."" Those quotes in the article are proof that those same types of landforms happened here on Earth as well and the ones here were not made by aliens.

In conclusion the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If there was aliens on Mars making landforms then NASA would definetely use that for publicity and to make the taxpayers happy. However there are no aliens on Mars making landforms and NASA knows this because of the time they have taken to research this along with the amount of pictures taken with high quality cameras and the resemblance of the landform to landforms on Earth.

307b540,"Dear Florida Senator,

The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. (Source 1) However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. (Some state laws vary) (Source 1) If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""(Source 3) In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3) you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Source 2) If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" (Source 2) In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote- basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. (Source 2)

The Electoral College also follows the ""Winner-take-all"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College (Source 3) what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.

Sincerely,

308be53,"Why The Facial Action Coding System Is Irrelevant

Sometimes people have bad days, and it can have a huge impact on others, but only if people choose to show it. Human emotion can be displayed in many ways. Some ways emotion can be expressed are through body language and facial movements/changes. However one chooses to show their emotion is all their decision, and it does not need to be known by everyone else. The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable because it is a person's own choice to decide whether or not they want someone else to know how they are feeling, emotions are not relevant to students in a classroom, and there are not many ways that knowing emotions can benefit people in their careers.

A person's emotions do not involve other people. Although emotions can be caused by others, emotions do not have to be known by others. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", by Nick D'Alto, the author states ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" If a person can already make a guess on how someone may be feeling on their own, why would they need The Facial Action Coding System? This would be an actual waste of technology because it would be doing a natural job that a human can do on their own.

Students in a classroom are there for learning about subjects such as math, science, language arts, and social studies, neither of which involves emotions. Bringing The Facial Action Coding System into a classroom would be more distracting than helpful. Students and teachers should be focused more on the lesson than how one is feeling during it. In the article, it says that ?A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,? Dr. Huang predicts."" In this case, students could also become very playful with the technology and trick it to access unreliable feedback.

Knowing emotions may benefit pychologists when wanting to understand the true feelings of one of their patients in a career based setting. However, in a classroom setting, reading student's emotional expressions is not needed. Some students may not enjoy school, but they are still required to go. The article notes that Dr. Huang adds ?Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.? This means that not only would The Facial Action Coding System be able to read the emotions of students, but it would also takeover the job of being a teacher. This is a disadvantage for teachers since they are there to answer any questions and do the lesson planning. This would also put many teachers out of a job.

There are very few benefits, there is no relevance for knowing the emotions of students, and any emotions of a person may not want to be detected, therefore The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable. Technology is supposed to be beneficial to humans and make life easier. The Facial Action Coding System does the opposite of that. Emotions should be revealed through a person's own wish, not through a computer. This could make many people very angry, due to the programming of this technology. The goal behind The Facial Action Coding System may be to read emotional expressions, but the emotions created, by people, from being able to do so could become very upsetting.       ",5
308e4ca,"Driverless cars are a dangerous thing that this society doesn't need. Driverless cars aren't completley driverless. They just stop doing their own thing as soon as they need the human help, this could cause accidents, tragic deaths, and lots of money from whoever is responsible. Are driverless, safe, cars really possible?

In 2009 the first ""driverless"" car could drive under specific conditions. It even drove ""half a million miles without a crash"". They still require a human driver to take over whenever pulling in and out of driveways. The driver also has to drive whenever there is roadwork or accidents, because the driverless cars aren't capable of figuring out where to go by themselves. The awesome cars on tv that drive all by themselves with no probelm really aren't a reality for us.

Some have hope that one day driverless cars may really happen, because of how far we've come with research and improvements. In the 1950s General Motors made a car that could drive on a special track, but the tracik was imbedded with electrical cable. This sent radio waves to the car to help direct it. Berkeley engineers tried something like this, they made it so the car could read positive and negative polarity in binary code. These experiments worked really well, but in order for that to work around the world we would have to upgrade every exsisting road. That's way to expensive and quite frankly to much to ask for such a new kind of technology.

In order to have driverless cars without changing every road in the world they would need lots of sensors. One sensor on the reer wheel, roof, rearview mirror, gps, inertial motion, and four automotive radar sensors. The combination of these sensors is supposed to mimic the skills of a human driving. We've used speed sensors before in the 1980s to create antilock brakes. These sensors over the time span of ten years became so advanced that they can detect out of control skids or rollovers.

In 2013 BMW developed a new car that has traffic jam assistance, they say the car can handle speeds up to 25 mph, but the car still requires the driver to keep hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. These cars have been givent he ability to steer, accelerate, and bake themselves, but they all still need a driver to alert when they can no longer handle the situation. The driver has to remain alert at all times, and be ready to take over at a moments notice. Manufacturers are considering using cameras insure the driver is watching the road while the car watches the driver.

Some manufacteres and drivers are afraid that the driver will get bored with only being able to drive half of the time. So they want to provide these cars with in-car entertainment, but still have a way to inform the driver that they need to take over, and will instantly shut the entertainment off. Traffic laws are made so that a car being driven by a human is the only safe way because they have control at all times. Some states fear accidents so they have banned even test driving these cars. These states would include California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia.

Even if traffic laws were to change, new laws would still be needed. These laws would need to cover liability in case the car got into an accident, because the new technology failed. If that were to happen people fear there would be huge fights over who is responsible for the damage. The manufacter or the person who was ""driving."" Telsa believes the 2016 project will be sucessful because they are creating a car that has the ability to drive 90 percent of the time. Still the car is not driverless.

Driverless cars are more harm than they are good. Sure they may save money on gas, but they would require a lot more attention than a normal car. Driving in a normal car you know you have to be alert all the time. In a ""driverless"" car you don't, but If it were me i'd be more alert because i'd be afraid that all of a sudden the car isn't going to handle what's going on and turn the responsibility over to me. This would cause lots of stress and anxiety whenever trying to drive. Driverless cars just aren't something we need. ",5
309bd04,"Facial expressions and emotions drive the actions of people everyday. These emotions are sometime hidden, fake or very transparent. I believe that using this Facial Action Coding System in class rooms, will be quite valuable to the learning enviroment and education of idividuals. It will increase learning efficiancy, focus in the class room, and productivity of the students.

The Facial Action Coding System essentially scans your face for emotion and makes decisions based on the results. This would be very valuable in a classroom especially those of younger students and gradeschool. During school students can be unmotivated to learn, bored or confused in the classroom. These problems can waste time and cause students to not fully understand and learn the topic.

If this system can produce the outcome predicted this will lessen the amount of time, and help students to understand the topic more and at a quicker rate. By moving at the students speed and manipulating the lessen at points where the student is confused can be more efficient than the classrooms now. This system will eliminate the wasted time, bordem and provide solutions for those confused.

As well as increasing the efficiency, this sytstem can also benefit the classroom enviroment. When students become bored or unmotivated, they can become a distraction in the classroom. Teachers then have to take time to meet the need the student has. This disruption in the class can catch the attention of other students and cause them to stop working and or act as the other student is. Distractions like these cause learning to be hindered and if eliminated it can better the learning enviroment for teachers and students. This system, can keep students active and motivated to learn, providing less of a chance to be a distraction.

Furthermore, if distraction, bordem and unmotivation is eliminated or improved in the classroom enviroment, this can increase productivity. Students when bored or unmotivated essentially stop working, and students who are confused work at a slower pace. These problems cause the work that needs to be done, not completed or completed slower than neccessary. This system can keep the attention of students and create a path that the student learns at their own rate, thus completing the work that needs to be done ontime or quicker. This can benefit the classroom because teachers do not need to review topics that some students might have understood but others have not.

In conclusion this system is the most efficient, productive and helpful tool that a class room could be aquipped with. It eliminates bordem and unmotivation, causes more efficient learning and allows productivity in the classroom to increase. All teachers should implement this tool in their classroom if presented the opportunity. ",5
30b779e,"What the Facial Action Coding System is a "" process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more mucles is called a ""action unit."" The man thing is weather or not this ""Facial Action Coding Syste"" should be used to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valube . But there can be some good things about this and there can be some bad things about this. The pros is id the computer can read if the kid is strugling with somthing and the teacher could come help the kid. Also the computer can read if the kid is depressed and needs help with somthing going on in his or her life. The cons isinvasion of privice. But with all these pros and cons I think we should have the ""Facical Actions Coding System"".

My first reason why we should have these computers is for school. In the artical the author says ""A classroom computer could recognizewhen a student is becoming confused or bored."" What this means if a kid is stuggling or confused the computer can read that the kid is in need of help on the thing he is working on and the teacher can come help the kid. Also the good thing is if the kid is confused and needs help, but if the kid is shy or scared to ask qustions the computer can tell the teacher he or she needs help on what they are working on. Last if the computer knows the person in confused the computer can stop what the kidis doing and help that person on what they are doing. This is my first reason on why we need this computer system in all schools.

My second reason is the computer can read kids emotions and can help the person. "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of corse, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This shows if a person is depressed and needs help but is scared to tell anybody the conputer can tell that friend so that friend can help that person out. Also this can tell if a person is angry and the actions that person could do when they are angry helping that person out and other people around them, beacuse of the actions that person can do while they are mad. Last this device can save lifes of people who think of suicide beacuse the computer can warn peopel these sighns helping the person out and many more people. This is my second reason why all schools should have the computer system.

My third and last reason is the computer can help that person be happy if they are sad and depressed. According to Facial Feedback Theoryof Emotions"" Putting on a happy face actually works!"" Also "" imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnt."" What this is saying is if you are watching somthing and ad comes on and it makes you happy the computer know that you like if and it would more like that. But if a ad comes on you dont like it and frown the computer knows that and will change it fast so you stay happy. With this computer doing that it could keep a lot of kid happy. This is my third reason why all schools should have this computer system.

Some people my not agree with me. Some people may say that it is advading your privace. But I think the computer should beacuse the computer can svae lives. Also help kids learn. Last it can keep kids happyand not sad. With the computer doing all of this we can keep a healthy life style and a safer envoroment for every body. This is why all schools should have this computer system to save lifes, help kids, and keep kids happy.",5
30be42a,"Driverless cars are revolutionizing the auto industry. This idea behind this futuristic technology is to allow the user to relax and not be bothered by the worries of the road. While this idea sounds nice in concept, when put into reality it just becomes illogical. It is for this reason that unless groundbreaking technology is discovered that can make driverless cars safe and practical, people should just continue to drive cars themselves.

One of the specific faults of driverless cars is the fact that they are not truly driverless. This is made evident when the author states that ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" (7). The whole purpose of developing computurized cars is so that no attention is required by the humans within the cars. If the human still has to be ""alert"" and ready to drive, then the entire point of having these automated cars is negated. The attention required by a human takes away from the ability to relax and not worry about the road. To that point, if the operator of the vehicle is not able to fully relax, he/she would much rather be solely operating the vehicle for the strict purpose of keeping occupied. If they cannot risk leaving the car alone to occupy themselves with other things, than the entire purpose of the driverless car has been defeated.

Another factor that argues against driverless cars is the issue of safety. While some may argue that the automation of the car takes away the factor of human error, this puts too much trust in the computers. While tested, and proven safe, it is still worrysome to think about the fact that the operator's life is solely in the driving skill of the computer that is driving the car. It is unrealistic to put this much trust into a computer preforming a predominantly human activity. Human knowlege, reactions, and skill are all key attributes in driving, which is why taking these attributes away may turn out to be dangerous. This is the reason that ""...in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"" (9). Things are not just made illegal without ample reason to do so. Clearly the United States government, the most powerful government in the world believes that there is too much risk involved in testilng, nonetheless driving these furutistic automobiles.

This idea of driverless cars follows the recent social trend of laziness. As a species we are beginning to rely more and more on computers to complete simple tasks that we are more than capable of completing ourselves. There is a point where technology is taken too far and that is the point where it has an opportunity to impact our safety. This is that point.      ",5
30c1119,"Dear state senator,

My letter is in regards to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that we, the people, should have the opportunity to choose whom we wish to become President.

The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote. It's a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? Its the fact that we aren't really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. And on top of that, there are still many people out there who don't have a clue that their actually voting for someone in our state to decide for us. Although the electoral college does help make the presidential election less complicated, it's the mere fact that WE aren't making much of a difference.

The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. When it comes to voting for electors, its a difficult thing when it comes to how many electors represent which political party. Democrat, or Republican. Say one wanted the one candidate running for president to win, and he/she were Republican. That person would go out and cast a vote for a slate of however many of republican electors there are for that state. The part that gets a lot of people is that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win and they voted in their residential state which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wasn't chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors votes are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democrats, the chances of the Democrat candidate having less electoral votes then the Republican candidate, has increased. If this problem happenes for several other states, then the chances double, even triple.

If this doesn't make you think that the electoral college should go, then think again. The electoral college is definitely unfair to voters. Any chance of unfaithful electors, could happen. It could make one feel betrayed that they voted foe a specific elector to do one job. Which was to help select the president the voter wanted. Whats the point in putting your trust in someone who could just easily turn around and NOT vote who you wanted? There is no point. But that's what we're doing when we vote. We are making it an option for that to happen. So why not vote by popular vote? Why not avoid all the issues the electoral college can cause for us? We should be lucky that back in '00, that was the biggest election crisis and it COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state doesnt't have the sam eamount of people in each, the chances of there being a tie in the presidential election, is slightly unlikely. Other then there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the votes add up tp 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election is confusing as it is. I say, we should get rid of the electoral college. It's not needed, and a pain.       ????       ???

30f0911,"People go through many emotions in a day an hour or even a minute. Our emotions are changing constanly and we don't even realize. Some people try to fake their emotions to others and some people let their emotions out into the world. Emotions come in many varities mad, sad, happy, confused, etc. As people look at us they can tell wether or not were happy, mad, or sad. They could tell by looking at our facial expressions, the way we talk, the way our body moves, and many more. As technology keeps taking over our daily lives as the years go on, a computer has been made to tell the emotions of an individual. It can tell the emotions of people in pictures, painting, or even right on the spot. The computer is thought to eventually end up in the classroom to tell the emotions of students. It would tell teachers if the students were bored or excited so they could fix their emotions on the subject they might be talking about. This has brought up the arguement as to whether the emotion telling computer should be brought into the classroom or not. Their are many different opinions on this topic. The emotion telling computer should be brought into the classroom. It would be a huge achievement for every school around the world to have this device. The emotion computer should be the next best thing in the classroom.

The computer could tell if the students were bored or not on a certain subject. If classrooms did have the computer teachers could look at it in the beginning and the end of class. It gives the teacher the advantage to see which method of teaching bores or excites them more. If many students were bored one day change it up the next. Once students begin to be more happy as the teacher goes on the more the students will want to learn. Students who are bored will not learn a thing, but students who are excited will be interested in learning and will get better grades. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr.Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(Huang) The emotion telling could change the way the lesson is being taught to make it more exciting. The more students are happy and excited about learning the better the test scores and grades. Some may argue that a computer would not be able to change the way a kid is feeling, however, it could make the teacher change the way his or her students are feeling. The computer should be used in the highschool classroom to tell the emotions of students.

The computer could make students feel better and interact more in the classroom. The could computer could analyze the patterns of emotion in students each day. If a student has been mad or sad, the teacher could ask them whats wrong and try to fix the situation. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The computer would be accurately precise on each students emotions. If a student was shown to be stressed or worried for a certain amount of days, a teacher could tell the parents so they could help him or her. The computer would help make many students feel better each day. Some may argue that anyone could tell the emotions of another, however, the computer could get down every single emotion in a percentage. The FACS computer needs to be in the classroom for everyone to use.

The emotion telling computer should be the next best thing in the classroom. The computer could do many things for students, parents, teachers, faculty, and many others, It can enlighten others to do better and want to learn more. Grades of students would be better, tests would be higher. Everyone would be in a lot better mood if we all had the computer. The Facial Action Coding System could do things no other would think was possible until now. The computer should be in every classroom; and you should urge others to consider making the computer the face of the future for every school. ",5
30ff0f0,"The year is 2041, and astronaut Jeff Goudard has just landed in the region of Cydonia. He is extremly exited becouse he will be the first human to see the only alien artifact known to man. As soon as he lands, he sees the face. Jeff's jaw drops practically to his feet. He relizes the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a plain old mesa, just like the ones out in the American West. Now just like this astronaut, there are probably hundreds of people that think that the ""Face on Mars"" is some sort of alien monuent, but in reality science and logical thinking has proven that in reality, the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a Mesa almost identical to the ones found out in the American West.

First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.

Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.

While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.

Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.

So just face the facts. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence. If you don't remember anything from this article, remember this: don't be Jeff.",5
319d75e,"Pretty much all working adults and teenagers own or drive a vehicle on a daily basis. But while all that driving may get you from point A to point B quickly, it is also doing great damage. Constant driving has left cities polluted and covered in smog. People are finally beginning to realize that and have begun making necessary changes in order to prevent this from continuing.

One suburb in Vauban, Germany is a great example of people limiting car use and the positive impact that it has. This upscale community has generally forbidden street parking, driveways, and home garages so that the streets of Vauban are completely car-free. About 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and over 50 percent sold their cars just to move there. Heidrun Walter, a Vauban local and mother of two, is quite pleased with the car ban. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This ban has drastically reduced greenhouse gas emmisions that come from tailpipes on cars. You may think giving up your car ride to work every morning is a terrible idea, but living with pollution, smog, and gas emmisions that lead to breathing problems sounds even worse.

The driving ban in Paris, France shows just how bad driving all the time can be. Due to the cold nights and warm days in the popular city, the warmer layer of air trapped car emmisions - causing five days of smog. Being that France has a tax policy that favors diesel and in turn makes up over 60 percent of vehicles in France, it was to blame for the intense smog. After days of near-record pollution, the French party banned driving until the smog cleared. People were left with the choice of leaving their cars at home or facing a 22-euro fine. This goes to show you that your daily driving habits have long-lasting effects that should be taken care of sooner rather than later.

For another example of people striving to lower air pollution, look at Bogota - a city in Columbia that bans cars for one day every year on the annual Day Without Cars event. The purpose of this ban is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. It's obviously doing well because now two more Columbian cities, Cali and Vallendupar, are joining the event. Even authories from other countries have visitied Bogota to witness the event themselves and were quite enthusiastic. Enrique Riera, mayor of Asunci┏n, Paraguay, said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change [that] is crossing borders"" after attending Day Without Cars. More parks and sports centers have opened up and sidewalks are now being replaced with smoother sidealks for people to walk on. Bogota is just one city now realizing the negative impact constant driving has on the town, as well as its people, and taking steps to lower those impacts.

In conclusion, there are many disadvantages to driving all the time. Which means a lot of postive advantages when we stop. Going completely car-free can be difficult - especially if you are in an area without buses or taxis, but you can still limit your driving and reduce greenhouse gas emmisions and pollution. Don't take so many driving trips, car pool with friends, invest in a bike or shop at places closer to you. Limiting your car usage is something everyone can do and will postively affect your environment.       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",5
31c2e4e,"To the State Senate,

Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popular-based vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fufilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ""...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" (3). This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.

According to Plumer, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (2). This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (2). This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states..."" (2). This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winner-take-all system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer,2). This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.

Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid Run-Off Elections..."" (Posner, 3). These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President?    ",5
32ad275,"There are so many advantages of limiting car usage. In source one, the Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"". This is for the good of not cluttering the streets with so many cars but actually making more space and less cars on the streets. In source one, it says ""while there hace been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the cocept to the suburbs."" That right there says they have been trying to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizens that transportation can be better to use. Instead of having over a million cars on the streets or high ways or anywhere, many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go. It also makes time for walking, which is a very good exercise. Many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store thats right there on the corner instead of walking. Many people have taken car usage over the limits and don't realize how it is polluting our air.

Pollution is a big problem in our ecosystem now and days. Many people don't clearly see this and don't take the time to process in how bad its making earth. Pollution has gone up over the years and decades after decades we have tried to stop it. In source two, it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Why? Well because of the exaggerated use of cars. They have tried to reduce the usage in order to make their air cleaner and better. They have gotten the idea of limiting car usage by ordering people with even-numbered license plates to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine on Mondays. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. With this new policy, it has shown better air in the city of Paris by Monday. I believe this is a great forced rule. We need to change our ways and work better in making our air cleaner.

Traffic jams is another downfall of using cars. With so many cars out in the streets it causes the air to have so much smog. Many people have participated in bike riding and walking, but not only is it exercise for your health but it keeps away from people using their cars. With so many people participating this action, not only has it made better air burt also constructed and cropped up new restaurants and shopping districts. They cleared the side walk to make it smoother and cut traffic, as said in source three. This is all in Bogota, Columbia. They said it has made a drastic change in their community with better air and I believe it has made their air better and way reduced smog.

In the United States, President Obama's goal was to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to many people participating in this action. A very big amount of Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and fewer licences as each year goes by as said in source four. To keep this at a going rate each year I believe citizens should work harder to improve more in this situation as in car pooling, bicycle and public transportation.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages in reducing car usage. Better air, better community and healthier citizens.    ",5
32aedc2,"Changing The Future

Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars.

Driverless technology has to be understood by the consumer. If the consumer does not know how this technology works, it could cause some serious damage.

The consumer has to realize that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, the consumer has to know that they have to remain attentive while being in the driver's seat. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (Driverless Cares Are Coming paragraph 7). Without the realization that they have to be attentive, some bad accidents could occur.

Liability for the accidents caused by driverless cars has to be settled. The companies that make the driverless cars, or the driver, it is yet to be determined who would be at fault. The company for making flawed technology, or the driver for being in the car. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturere?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 9). This will be a huge issue if driverless cars do become legal. Driverless cars could effect the people in more way than one.

The effect of drivers in the future if cars become driverless. Their is a great possibility of issues coming with driverless cars, some subtle, and some severe. Also, who would want a driverless car if you still had to driver it? That does defeat the purpose of the name of the car. ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 8). Being occupied while sitting there is imperative. People will become bored if they have to just sit in the seat all day long. Companies have to come of with entertainment systems, but an issue with that is losing attention. While being in the driver's seat of a driverless car, being attentive is imperative. There may be situations where the car cannot handle it, and it requires human skills. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 7). There is a double whammy right there. Companies have to balance out occupying the driver and keeping them attentive; but there is no way to be distracted and attentive at the same time.

The risks involved with driverless cars are way to high for the potential payoff. The technology that is being developed might have a future, but in the near future, there is no way it'll work. Right now, they aren't even driverless cars, the cars still require a driver. Surely there will be progress on that aspec of the cars. Just simple knowing how the cars work is the first obsticle. Also, being able to figure out who is liable for damages between the manufacturer, or the driver of the car is a huge issue that comes with this. Lastly, how it will effect future driver's skills, and attentiveness while driving. Will there be a future in this industry, or not? Only time will tell.          ",5
32d692d,"Using the same technology configured using the Facial Action Coding System into school technology would be a valuable tool in the classroom because the often hidden signals or vibes students show can often give teachers mixed feelings about the effectiveness of their lessons or how student are being treated emotionally by others, but this is still something that we must not make this something that interfears or plays with the personal feelings of the students. It would be a valuable addition to any classroom for its in-depth look into how the information is reaching the students, how they are reacting, and what the teacher can do differently to get the most out of thier lesson plans.

Especially in the mornings and end of the day, students' laziness, tiredness, or anticipation to get home can often disturb with how teachers percieve how their lesson plans are effecting the child. With the same Facial Action Coding System in our own school computers, online activities and assignments can track the emotional responses of the students while they work such as their attentiveness. Since this technology is, ""compared against a neutral face"", teachers will be able to witness firsthand their student's reactions. Oftentimes, early morning weariness or late school day excitement can fool the teacher's perception of the situation, but with the analyzing of the six basic emotions using ""video imagery"" of the, ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"", this technology would be able to offer to give an accurate conclusion to the student's reactions to each lesson.

Another commonly addressed situation is when students become ""confused or board"" with an assignment; both of these natural reactions show that the challenge level is not suited to the student's level. Teachers often want to offer help to the confused and challenge or entice board students, but these emotions are often not shown to the human eye. Especially with confused students, they hide this sense of confusion from the teacher to avoid embarassment. However, with this new technology, students who need more attention can be noticed. With the software's facial recogntion using minor muscle movements, it can make a conclusion without the student fully showing the emotion. With this in depth look, teachers are able to provide tutoring for those who need extra explaination and modify of their lessons for individuals who are not finding interest or challenge in the current lesson. With this technology, teachers will be able to realize how challenged each student needs to be even when they put up a ficade.

Another way that this teachnology can offer help to the students is with the daunting and huge school problem of bullying and depression before it leads to events much more serious. Since this technology picks up on feelings such as fear or saddness, these indications could be the first warning signs of when a student is taking their first steps into one of these two situations. Such as with the example of politicians and celebrities, even fake smiles are attributes will be able to be seen through. This is a serious problem in our day and age, so if these signs are reported reguarly and continuously, this may be the closest a student comes to calling for help. With this information not being able to be tricked through false emotions, students can recieve the mental and emotional help or stability they need.

Despite this great new innovation as well as all of the new data teachers can gather on their methods of teaching, we must ensure that this technology does not dive into the personal emotions students want to keep to themselves. Because many schools are now having take-home Chromebooks or Ipads, the school board needs to make sure that the students have thier own emotional security when at home. Teachers need to be careful and be reminded that there is a boundery between checking up with these emotional resonces for lesson planning and interfearing with the student's personal life. Otherwise, stuents will feel insecure both in and out of school because their core emotions such as a recent breakup might be revealed.

Facial Action Coding Systems for schools would allow teachers and students to more understand each side's perspective, so the students can be helped to the fullest extent they can be taught. This simple idea is building off of the simple idea of everyday empathy into the perspective of our school technology. This new technology would come with a pricetag, but being able to more effectively teach in the classroom would be well worth the money. Human emotions can be a difficult factor to implicate seen with examples such as the varying emotions with The Mona Lisa, but this technology will allow us to revolutionize our schools into an education build by the reactions of students and the lesson modifications of teachers.

02d481d,"Dear, Senator

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that? the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they? might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.    ",6
06e2db4,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

07a14a5,"The author's claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is closely related to Earth, Venus has a enviroment that is similar to Earth, and scientists want to explore more of what Venus has to offer.

The first claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus is closely related to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars our other planetary neighbors orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner, in space terms, humans have sent numerous to land on this cloud draped world. Each precious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us"" (Paragraph 2). This supports the author's claim because the author believes that scientists should study Venus because Venus is closely related to Earth.

The second claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that Venus has a similar enviroment to Earth. In the passage, it states,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (Paragraph 3). This supports the author's claim because there are many physical and enviromental dangers that are present on Venus. Despite all of Venus's dangers, scientists still want to explore Venus in depth.

The third claim of why the author supports scientists studying Venus is that the author supports the further exploration of Venus by scientists. In the passage it states,"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option to visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?. NASA has one particulary conpelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vechile hovering over Venus would aviod the unfrendily ground conditions by staying up and out of thier way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy, conditions, but survivable for humans."" (Paragraph 4 and 5). This supports the author's claim because scientists want to know more about Venus's planatery history and similarities to Earth.This statement also supports the author's claim because the scientists wants to try and send humans to Venus.

Therefore, the author's claim supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by Venus being closely related to Earth, Venus has a similar enviorment to Earth, and the author encouriging further explorations to Venus.       ",6
07d41ed,"The use of the Facial Action Conding System would be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it will detect how the student feels about the task at hand. If it detects that the student is bored it could modify the lesson to make them more awake and begin working on the task at hand. This technology could also help find each students way of learning. For example if one student works hands on and another works by taking notes then the system can mofify both programs to fit their learning style. This technology also could help teachers see if a student understands a topic, and if they see they don't or they are becoming frustrated with it they can modify the lesson. Using this system would be of value to students and schools, because it not only would help students learn but it would also help teacher teach.

If a student is feeling bored with his or her work the Facial Ation Coding System can modify the task at hand and make the student more prone to continue and finish the work. This claim is supported by the article because it says ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This would help the teacher help the student make changes. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This technology not only helps students become more inclined in school work but it also helps teachers

This technology could help find each students way of learning by detecting each facial expression to see if they are inclined in the task at hand. For example, if one student is understanding and enjoying the way a lesson is being taught, the system could modify each of their lessons to fit their way of learning. But if another student doesn't like the way a lesson is being taught the system can test out different styles until the correct one is found. The article supports this by stating ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow."" This example could go for both advertisment and school work. ""If you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system can be used to see if a student is enjoying and understanding a lesson as well as not enjoying and understanding a lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System could help teachers see if a student is understanding a topic or lesson. It could do this by detecting their facial expression then letting the teacher know if changes need to be made. This would help because it allows the teacher to know if thier methods of teaching are acually being of value to the student. This claim is supported because the article includes ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This supports the claim because it shows that the software can identify not only one emotion but serveral. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The technology can analize and detect certain emotions and allow the teacher to see all of them and make modifcations if they are needed.

Using this system would be a value to schools because it not only helps students learn but it would help teachers teach. It would allow teachers to see how certain kids learn and modify their lessons to fit. It would also allow students to be more inclined in the task at hand. This system would be a great value to education and how kis are taught.         ",6
0a22908,"The author of this work is in favor of taking on the great challenge of landing a ""rover"" on Venus for research and exploration. Venus has many extreme conditions that the earth does not have to endure. The author presented many ""solutions"" to these problems. Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best.

Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.

An additional idea that was brought up by the author was ""Silicon electronics."" Siliscon electronics would be resistent to the harsh conditions on the planet-- for a while. The systems would run for about a month before total failure. these silicon systems are very expensive to bein with and are still in the development phase here on earth. Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture. And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented.

Lastly, a ""cave-man"" idea of mechanical computers came into play. These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.

The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet. The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical. A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best. Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with machanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings. Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp. Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question.

Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes. After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure. The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space.  ",6
0a9488d,"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""? If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well.    ",6
0aae146,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.       ?    ?    ?       ?    ",6
0d2070c,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is speculated to have been the most similar to Earth, studying it can be done at reasonable expectations, and combatting the difficulty of studying Venus will have great benefits to our knowledge on the planet itself and space exploration.

It has long been a conspiracy yet to be proven as to if Venus is one of our known sister planets that are the most similar to Earth today. Space explorers long ago predicted that Venus was likely covered with large oceans and had the potential to possibly support multiple forms of life. Without an indepth study of Venus at a close and personal view, nothing can be predetermed factually. In paragraph four the author explains that ""it [Venus] may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that the possibility is there but without extra measures taken to pursue an indepth study, the question remains unanswered as to if Venus is a sister planet of Earth.

While an upclose, indepth view of Venus is not predictable due to the harsh environment, NASA has found potential ways to make exploration dueable to an extent. In paragraph five, the author states that: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This helps widen the idea that exploration of Venus can be done and met at a reasonable expectation and limit safe for explorers. The author proceeds to state that while the conditions are not particularly easy they are ""survivable for humans."" This helps detail and push for the idea of the exploration of Venus because it is and has been discovered that the study can be done safely.

The overall study of Venus can prove to be extremely beneficial to our knowledge on the planet alone, and our knowledge on space exploration at most. In paragraph eight, it is stated that ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" In which it does, combatting the challenge of Venus proves to be tough, but if done, it can mean more to the exploration of other planets that are tougher than Venus alone. Further in paragraph eight, it is said that ""travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Once we begin to limit our exploration and discoveries due to the dangers and doubts, we take away from our progression of knowing what is out of our way. With the study of Venus we can extend our doings to meet every innovation and curiosity about our solar system all together.

Studying Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. With the study of Venus we can determine if Venus is a sister planet of our planet today, and if the planet was once inhabitable for organisms and humans. Studying Venus is also worth the pursuit because the study can be done, and if the study is done, it will benefit us far more than the study of any other planet has yet to. The study of Venus will bring our knowledge and our future immense benefits in all aspects.    ",6
0dcf2f6,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives the reader basic insight on what Venus is, its history, why scientists are trying to explore it, and the challenges scientists have faced.

Overall it is a very informative article and the point of it was to convince the reader that despite all of the struggles there is that comes with exploring Venus, that it is worth exploring anyway.

Though it is an admirable arguement, it is simply not supported throughout this type of article.

In the article, the author does not support his or her argument well because of his or her informative over-kill, lack of analysis, and lack of data in his or her favor.

To begin, the author gives us too many facts that are simply just an introduction. In paragraph three, the whole paragraph is stating facts about Venus and its atmosphere.

For example the author states that, ""...atmospheric pressure is 90 times great than what we experience on our own planet.""

This does resonate with the arguement considering that it is about how Venus should be explored despite the challenges.

The real problem with this example is that this is placed in the third paragraph and everything before it was also facts.

The author spent three paragraphs talking about the weather of Venus instead of analyzing how it should be disregared and we should explore it for better reasons. Additionally, the author gives facts that have nothing to do with the arguement provided.

In the second paragraph, the author states that, ""...sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.""

This simply has nothing to do with the supposed topic.

Not only is there too many facts, but these facts have nothing to do with the topic and the author seems to -in fact- trail off a bit.

Multiple times.

Additionally, the author seems to provide no analysis towards the plethera of information.

For example, the first true analysis is seen is in paragraph five when he or she states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

By the time someone is writing to paragraph five, there should already be an extreme of amount of noticable analysis before that.

The basic structure of any arguement would be to state a fact, and give a well thought-out analysis about that fact and how it applies to one's topic.

The noticable structure here, would be an overwhelming amount of facts, and then slight analysis by assuming that the evidence speaks for itself.

When you have that much information thrown at the reader at once, the evidence really doesn't speak for itself.

That's where the supposed analysis comes in.

The analysis is supposed to connect the dots for the reader and explain how it applies.

It seems that is lacking here.

Finally, the author seems to be arguing against themselves with the type of evidence that is being presented.

Throughout the whole article the author seems to be only stating the things wrong with this idea.

For example in paragraph two, the author states that, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for than a few hours.""

Then backed that up with no analysis on how that should be worth the risk so scientists can can continue exploring.

This is a problem because that is the point of the article: that despite all the risks, scientists should perservere. That's is not what followed that unsettling fact, though.

All that followed was more facts.

Additionally in paragraph six, the author finally states a good fact on how exploration can continue, but then follow it with analysis that once again goes against the arguement.

For example, after talking about the solution NASA has made to this problem, the author follow it with, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight...""

This was a poor choice of support because the author is basically going against his or her idea, without reconciling it.

In conclusion, the author makes it unclear which side he or she is trying to prove.

It is a very well-written article, but only for informational purposes.

If one it looking for a well-supported idea on how despite all the risks, science should continue, this article is not the place to look.

If anything, it seems that the author is arguing against continuing to explore Venus-considering all the facts and analysis that went against the idea.

Once again, this is a well written informative article, not an arguable one.",6
0f789a2,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right. ",6
1013fcd,"The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen. The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students because it would decrease the rate at which students learn, identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling, and it would decrease their motivation for work in the future.

The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. The author states that the machines will ""recognize when the student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective intructor"" (D'Alto 6). This would be harmful to the students determination to learn. It would also cause several students to fall behind in their education. Every student experiences boredom in class, but the teacher is unable to change the lesson everytime to best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind. Students are still capable of learning material when they are bored even if it is not as effectively as when they are interested. Students need to also learn how to work through their emotions to better their ability to improve. When these students get into the work field, they can not call in sick or slack off every time they experience a negative emotion. This device would be teaching children that they should only be productive if they are intrigued by their task. This would not be a proper lesson to teach growing individiuals.

The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.

The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation. The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because ""most human connection is nonverbal"" (D'Alto 6). Although that statement is true, there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. This may cause people to reply more on the machines, which would lessen the amount of human connection that exists--much like previous technology advances have done. Human connection is essential to a striving population, therefore it will have negative affect on society.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees.",6
14174ed,"Facial recognition, a thing of the future, at least that's what people thought. With the new age of innovative technology, a special field of new technology has come to the public, facial recognition software. One of the most prominent softwares in the facial recognition field is the FACS, or facial action coding system, which is what was used to figure out exactly what emotion Mona Lisa was feeling in her painting. However, this software could be used in many other fields. The ability to read and detect what emotion some are feeling is very powerful and could be implimented into certain areas such as the classroom. The usage of FACS could be very beneficial to schools for reading students emtions so teachers could see how their learning plan affects the students, organize and figure out which subjects students may enjoy more, and also allow schools to see what areas of the school may need to be improved on the most.

By using facial recognition, teachers would be ablel to read the expressions on students' faces and see what their learning plan make the students feel. A prime example of how this could be used in the classroom would be in paragraph four, where the author states "" 'The facial expressions for each emotion are are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" This specific example is important because by using this software, the facial movements of every student could be tracked, without worry of missing something, and could therefore help teachers distinguish how all their students feel about their lesson plan. Along with that, in paragraph six the author states something similar to this main point ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is exactly what the point is, the computer could tell what needed to be changed and why.

Along with seeing how the teacher's plan affects the students, FACS could also potentially allow students to be organized and grouped up by what subject they appear to enjoy the most. Computers and computer programs are used most often for the usage and organiztion of data, that is what defines computer code, sets of data being used in certain ways. Well, the same type of usage could be had in a classrooom for organizing which subject students liked more. In paragraph five the author writes ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specfic emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical informatino as electronic code."" This points out that code already stores the data that it takes in and knows how to use it. That takes out a step in the process of using it in the class. By having it store data, the computer could then organize it into sections based on what students appeared more happy in certain classes and help with finding interests. Also, in paraghraph four the author states ""By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This is especially important due to the fact that sometimes students can feel mixed about the class they are in, which means the computer can help figure out how they may feel truly about the subject.

Above the learning aspect, schools could see where students physically feel the best or worst in the school or class. While the majority of use would be for the learning portion of the class, FACS could also be used quite often to help discern what physical things may need to change in the school. Maybe a student in a poor chair shows discomfort and the school learns it needs better chairs. In paragraph five, the author writes ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" While this is true, many people are able to easily figure out what a face may mean, the computer would have an even easier time doing it with lighting quick judgement and fast calculations to back it up. The usage of these quick calculations could be beneficial and allow the school to have a better input system and see exactly how the school feels, rather than relying on teahcers to figure out how the students may feel. Another good example of how the FACS could help improve school's physical aspects would be in paragraph six where the author uses and example of improvement themself by stating ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This example shows very well how the computer recognition could really tend to one's needs and how one feels, therefore helping improve the quality of the school.

Overall, facial recognition software is a very promising and prominent idea for the future of classrooms. The computer's ability to see how the learning plan affects the students and change the plan based on the response to the FACS being able to organize and find which subject the students like more in their school is extremely crucial to the new innovative learning process. Also by helping improve the overall quality of the school, the software is something that certain schools should look into. Hopefully this idea of facial recognition software in schools can become a reality and eventually become a nationally recognized function to aid in the learning process. Once an idea of the future brought into the modern day, the Facial Action Coding System truly has an eye for all things emotion.",6
16395a4,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has 44 major muscles in the human face programmed and their movements detectable by its software. While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed. The FACS could change how schools work forever if they were used in our classrooms and it would be for the benefit of our students.",6
1ac7f5b,"In Nick D'Alto's article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the value for technology is absurd, because in certain situations everyone should not be exposed to the emotions of others. For example, emotions are extremely personal and sometimes it is not technically appropriate to showcase every emotion you are feeling. A student or teacher could be going through something personal, that needs to be left out of the workplace and school. Success at school or work in general depends on how you engage in those specific tasks at hand, so the emotions the computer is claiming you are having should not interfere with specific things outside of your personal life. Detecting emotions should be left out of serious, and professional environments such as work or school. Lastly, the computer is only trained to detect the movement of the muscles in your face. But your face may not always match the feeling of emotion inside, so this may not be the most appropriate device to truly rely on.

The importance of keeping emotions personal, and not oversharing with people around you is extremely important. Most students are usually adolescents and they sometimes have a hard time expressing and controlling their emotions. So having a device eager to showcase their feelings can be dangerous and insensitive. Eckman has already begun to classify specific emotions including; ""anger, fear, disgust, and sadness,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3). The negative emotions should not be shared! A computer should not illustrate how you are feeling on the inside to others. This can awaken a lot of frustrated, and haphazard behavior among teens if something is constantly around proclaimming it understands how everyone is feeling. D'Alto also states, ""associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (Paragraph 3). The muscles in the face should not be studied by a computer, and they should not be able to invade the privacy of the muscle movement in someones face. Also, some may argue that their face does not always match what they are feeling, so that leaves alot of room for confusion, and flaws on the systems part. It's untraditional, and orthodox, and an invasion of mental privacy.

Everyone is different, whether life is amazing or terrible, someone should not be able to be read or determine how you are feeling by what a computer says about their face. Some teachers or students could be dealing some serious, and personal things that should not find their way into the workplace or school. But, if this device is constantly procclaiming a student or teacher is sad or upset about something personal it is completely unneccessary. Students should not know the personal lives of their teachers or vise versa. This is an ambigous invasion of privacy, and could potentially even amount to a crime or disservice to some people. D'Alto questions the reader, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 6). This only has limited benefits and could cause immense problems in relation to others knowing personal things relating to your emotions. The specific boundaries it crosses especially if you are not well acquainted with the people constantly around you is alarming. D'Alto claims again, ""Can your lab partner recognize which one?"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). There should be absolutely no valid reason, why someone you may not know should be able to, and have the capacity to read your emotions from looking at you. In schools, sometimes in relation to this specific example, students are not acquainted with their lab partners or the people around them. So this would be like giving a stranger a clear look, and picture into another persons mind! It would be like being allowed to read the mind of others around you. This specific example is horrible in attempt to promote their product, and scares the consumers with the thought of others starring into their souls.

Technology has never been a reliable thing, it has never lived up to its name and full potential when people truly want it to. The thought of a computer having this amount of control is excessive, and unrealistic. In Paragraph 7, D'Alto states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). If our PC's cannot handle the Mona Lisa, how will they have the capacity to decode our real life, actively changing faces? Can the creators of this system not see their flaws? D'Alto continues to suggest, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 5). This passage is inferring to the reader that the only logical way a computer can read information is through and electrical code. Humans do not produce emotions through an electrical code, so it is not logical to expect their emotions to be read to through an emotional code.

All in all, the idea was ambitious, but it defintely was not original or rationally thought out. The thought of a computer reading into personal emotions, attempting to decode issues that are too personal to be brought into school and work, and essentially incorrectly interpret emotions is absurd. This whole idea invades the privacy of the people in society, and is a very touchy subject that should not be programmed into a computer.      ",6
1b45c61,"Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.

First of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Being able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could ""read"" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.

Also, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment. The differences between a fake and real smile may seem like an easy task to distinguish in real life, and it may appear to be a problem for a machine. However, the information written by D'Alto from the interview with Dr. Huang show that the machine will have no problem distinguishing a real, genuine happy smile from a fake, intentionally deceiving grin. Therefore, a student could not effectively trick the machine into changing a lesson in a classroom environment.

Finally, in paragraph 9, a study on facial expressions and their relation to emotions is cited. In this study, many important ideas about feelings carried out by humans are stated with truthfulness and security. For example, the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion states that moving your facial muscles can not only express emotions, but can even help produce them. This states that real emotions can occur from just making a face. Even if the person who was making the expression originally was not feeling that emotion, they may in fact feel that way after one small change in their expression. Also, the author references a ""renowed drama coach,"" Constantin Stanislavsky, who states that he forced his actors to reproduce the actions of smiling and frowning so they genuinely feel happy or sad when on stage. Overall, a change in one small part of your face can change how you feel, and if this technology is implemented into classrooms throughout America, that one small change could alter the way students feel about learning.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as mentioned in Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" could be used in classrooms to successfully ""read"" the faces of students, alter the lesson in some way just for them, and make sure each student is happy with what they are hearing and seeing. If this technology is implemented into classrooms around the globe, students will be more excited about their learning experiences, possibly receive much improved grades, and be more happy people in gerenal. If the faces of the next generation are happier than ever, what's to come afterword could be even better.",6
1cbab90,"The author's claim in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is not well supported by the evidence provided, and the reasoning behind the evidence. The author claims that the planet Venus would be a worthy goal to pursue, despite the dangerous conditions and harmful atmosphere that the planet posseses. The author provides information on possible ways that we could overcome the challenge of landing on the planet Venus, but no clear reason as to why we should pursue this goal besides his own rationalization of a reason provided at the end of the article. Not only is the evidence that the author provides theoretical in the efficiency of the tools stated on another planet, but the purpose of the tools in collecting samples and taking photos is not descibed or elaborated on. Despite the risks, the author has no clear reason for the benefit of landing on Venus, and the tools that the author proposes do not support the idea that it would be possible to land on Venus and actively collect samples or take pictures.

The author claims that the value of returning to Venus ""seems indisputible"" in paragraph 4, but the only reason for this claim is his analogy that Venus is similar in structure to Earth. In paragraph 5, the author states that a possible way to approach the planet seems possible, because NASA had an idea to create ""a blimp-like vehicle to hover over Venus."" The author in paragraph 6 states that the blimp would only allow us to recieve ""limited insight"" on the planet, and we would not be able to take samples or take pictures due to the dense atmosphere. The author does not provide any possible way to collect samples and overcome this issue, besides stating how ""many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This statment provides no actual evidence as to any progress researchers have made, or if anything useful will come from the knowledge of the surafce Venus.

In paragraph 7, the author mentions a technology made of ""silicon carbide"" that has been tested by NASA, and survived a simulation of the conditions of Venus for three weeks. The author does not elaborate on the uses for these strong electronics, and leaves the reader guessing at the purpose of this technology. The author also mentions the use of mechanical computers used in the 1940s during World War II. The author speaks of how these computers make calculations by using gears and levers, but does not elaborate on anything else besides their increased resistance to ""pressure, heat, and other forces."" Once again the author provides no clear reason to the purpose behind the inventions, besides the possible survival of the technology on Venus.

Finally, the author presents his own opinion in paragraph 8. The author states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planent itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Paragraph 8, as the author has wrote, is entirely opinionated and dangerously optimistic. His reasoning behind the value of ""meeting the challenge of Venus"" is the equivalent to practice for humanity, because ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally indimidating endeavors."" The authors opinion of the research on Venus, as shown by this statment, seems to be entirely based on the idea that we should practice for future endeavors despite the dangers which is not only naiive, but dangerous.

To summarize all of this information, the author shows no clear reason as to why we should risk the resources and manpower to attempt an expedition on Venus. The author provides no purpose for the tools stated besides their increased survivability rate, and the author's opinion is forced onto the reader by stating in paragraph 8 that we should ignore the dangers and doubts of exploration to meet the limits of innovation. The author poorly supports his claim of ""a worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" and provides no facts or evidence for the benefits of humanity attempting the challenge of Venus.           ",6
1f2ec63,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" many challenges of studying Venus are presented; however, the author provides many valid reasons as to why researchers should find ways to study this planet. The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind.

The author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time.

Another way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this.

Lastly, the author supports his/her claim by explaining how overcoming the challenge of studying Venus, would be beneficial not only to the insight of the planet, but also of human curiosity. The author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The claim is strongly supported through the author's description of how studying Venus could be beneficial to the human mind. Another detail from paragraph 8 is, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author supports that studying Venus would be worth overcoming the harsh conditions, as it would expand our views of imagination and innovation.

Despite all of the author's reasons for studying Venus, he/she describes how Venus has harsh conditions that must be overcome first. The text states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author expresses how Venus's conditions are far more extreme than any conditions on Earth. However, the author supports their claim by providing various reasons that support how Venus is worty of pursuit and how researchers may go about overcoming the dangers it possesses.

In order to support his/her claim, the author was able to provide at least three strong reasons that show how Venus would be worth studying, even though it presents many dangers. By explaining how Venus may have once been comparable to Earth, providing solutions to current problems, and expressing the benefits of studying Venus, the author is able to strongly support his/her claim with valid evidence.

223b86d,"The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. Through advancements in digital imagery, an understanding of shadows, and an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, it can be concluded that the face on mars is just a myth.

Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.

Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This excerpt from the article explains that the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.

While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon, they are mistaken. With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. However, others still argue.

Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. The article mentions, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars."" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.

So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.

26479a8,"After the nice, relaxed weekend at the beach, Steve gets up to go to work at 6 AM to go to work that is half an hour away. His Monday morning seems to be great until he jolt upright, suddenly remembering about the end-of-the-month report he was supposed to do over the weekend. Steve scrambles around his house, quickly changing into his work clothes and shoving food in his mouth as he runs out the door. As Steve drives to work, he tries to think of ways he can get the report done quickly, but he eventually prepares himself for the verbal lashing he will recieve from his boss. Steve can be anyone. Forgetting to do work is a common occurance. Steve, however, could have gotten the report done if he did not have to drive to work. A relatively new technology that could have saved Steve from his boss' rage is the driverless car. A driverless car, obviously, does not require a driver most of the time. Google and many other car companies have been trying to perfect the driverless car by making the car not require a driver. There are many pros to driverless cars that far outweigh the cons. Driverless cars are more safe and saves time for the driver.

Every year, many people die in car accdients, whether the victim was the driver or an innocent pedestrian. Driverless cars can potentially lower the rate of car accidents. Unlike humans, driverless cars can detect objects around them with multiple sensors installed in the car. The Google-modified Toyota Prius uses nine sensors - ""position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel,

a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"" (Paragraph 4). Also, the rotating sensor on the roof, called the LIDAR, makes a 3-D model of the cars surroundings. With all of these sensors, the driverless car can detect objects or people that a normal human driver cannot see, as there are many blindspots that a human driver has to be wary of. Also, the car can also ""cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine"" (Paragraph 5) based on the information received from the sensors. This gives the car ""better response and control than an a human driver could manage alone"" (Paragraph 5).

Although the idea of a driverless car sounds appealing, the current cars developed do not drive the full amount of time. The cars needs to alert the driver in special situations like work zones and driveways. Therefore, drivers need to be alert the whole time just in case one of these special situations pop up. If you have to be alert the whole time, why not just drive in the first place? Also, what happens if the car hits someone? Would it be the driver's fault or the manufacturer's fault? There are legal issues that can be avoided if humans just drove the cars in the first place like they have been doing for the past century. In addition to the legal problems and the drive time problem, the car can become faultly, like a computer that got a virus. This time, the consequences of faulty electronics are much higher than just replacing a computer. The car could end up taking someone's life.

The current driverless car does not drive the entire time. However,Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are expected to have cars that can drive of 90% of the time. Yes, there is a 10% chance that a human driver might have to take over but the 90% of the time that the driver is not driving, he or she can do work or just relax. Even if the driver fell asleep, there are many ways that the car can wake the driver up, like vibrating seats, sounds, and bright lights. Cars can be developed to become better at driving in traffc zones. The human instanct, however, cannot be developed to be more cautionous all of the time. Also, the legal issues do not present a problem. Laws often change to adapt with the times. Courts and lawmakers can debate on the issues, resolve them, and change the laws so that they can accomodate conflicts that the drierless car might present.

Driverless cars can solve many vehicle-related safety issues and lower the accident rate. Also, they give the driver more time to do whatever he or she wants to do. There are very little cons that come with the driverless car, and the ones that do come up can be easily solved. Driverless cars should be allowed to continue to develop so that eventually, they can replace humans drivers and make the roads mroe safe. Steve, too, can get a happy ending by frantically finishing is report while his new driverless car can take him to work.      ",6

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" each section explains the valuable improvements technolody is making; however, one can argue that this new Facial Action Coding Sysytem may not excel in the classroom. This system enables a computer to read the expressions of humans but this may not be as effective as it seems. The author explains that this system could be used in the classroom in order to benefit the students lessons. This may be effictive to some degree; however, the computer system can not understand the students thought process. The Facial Action Coding Sytem would not be as valuable in the classroom in order to read the emotional expressions of students.

The Coding System created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe is a computer that uses a 3-D model of the face in order to ""claculate"" the expressions and emotions of a human. Prof. Huang and Sebe also collaborated with a psychologist in order to simplify the machine toread and code six basic emotions. These six basic emotions- happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness- do not cover the overall nature of human expressions. This is already one fault in the idea. Students in any grade level have many different ways of expressing their feelings and emotions whether that be through nonverbal facial recongnition or body movement. The ""basic six"" would not accurately cover each expression portrayed by the user and it could lead to a simple, yet common mix up.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When broken down Dr. Huang is stating that the system could replace a human instructor in order to teach the student based on his or her emotional reaction to the lesson being taught. This is not a valuable asset for stdents who may simply not enjoy the lesson being taught, whether they understand it or not. A common stereotype is that all highschool students are tired, which for the most part is accurate, whcih could confuse the system with the idea that the student is unhappy about the lesson. An honors student may then have the lesson simplified to a point it is no longer of any value to the learner. According to renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, ""Putting on a happy face actually Works!"" This is another reason the system could be easily decieved with false readings of a student. They could simply put on their happy face and a computer attempting to read the emotion of that person would not be ""calculating"" an acutal emotion. This would not benefit the student's learning process nor their social relationships.

Social relationships are a major part throughout school and this system would take a lot of the interaction away from students and teachers. Unable to help students, the social nature in interactions between students and higher authorities would be negative. Dr. Huang notes that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This may be true; however, taking away the interactions and basic knowledge of students manners could be harmful. Even though there are pros to this system, such as video surgery that make computer-animated faces more expressive, there is not a need for the system in an everyday classroom.

Facial Coding in the classroom would not benefit the stuents learning process or social interractions. There are myriads of ways to express emotions nonverbally without facial recognition. Six basic emotions may not accurately decribe the feeling of ones current stae of mind in the classroom, which could affect the lesson given to him or her. Social relatiosnhips could be lost when relying on a machine to determine one anothers feelings and ""putting on happy faces"" may damper ones ability to express their emotions. The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable to the students in a classroom environment.                ",6
2f3bda4,"Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.

Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.

By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.

Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.

Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. If you had the choice to experience in this program within your classroom, what do you thing the outcomes may be? ",6
30c179a,"Driverless cars, is this in our future? Driverless cars have become a growing topic in the past years. Recently, more information has become visible to the general public. Are these cars a good idea? I believe driverless cars are not needed in the near future. Development of these cars is an unneeded advancement in technology. Driverless cars, as of the technology we are now given, are not as reliable as an independent driver, they invade your privacy, and it would take more money to install technology in roads to be able to make use of these cars. Driving is a symbol of independence, in the sense that you are given the responsibilty and freedom to go virtually any location you please by driving yourself there.

Self driving is a commonly used way of transportation amongst many individuals. Driving is a way of transporting ones self from point A to Point B. When most individuals are driving, the average spped exceeds 25 mph. Driverless cars are only reliable for simple driving functions up to 25 mph. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars are completely driverless."" If driverless cars were to become a prominent part of every driver's life, would it be very practical? In the article, the author states what the cars are capable of, even with the driverless technology, the car will never be fully independent. The car is not completley driverless, this will be an unneccassary advancement until manufacturers create a truly driverless vehicle. So, using these new cars may be seemingly pointless, as the driver will still need to be paying attention and the car has sensors to make sure the driver is paying attention. This leads me to my next point, is a driverless car worth giving up your privacy?

Driverless cars not only have sensors on the wheels to make sure you are paying attention, they have cameras on your dashboard to ensure you are paying attention. ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" While some people may argue this is for the safety of the driver, there is no valid reasoning that there should be a manufacturer watching your every move to ensure you are paying attention on the road. Cars that have been driven that are not driverless have been doing, overall, well. While drivers are able to pay attention to the road regularly, having a camera creates an unwanted pressure to the driver. Adding the pressure of knowing you are constantly being watched as a driver can raise your stress levels, resulting in frustrated driving. Frustrated driving is an unsafe form of drivng, where as driving while relaxed and unwatched, relieves the pressure of knowing you are not the only person in the car. In addition, in the current days and in the past, has there ever been a need for manufacturers to put a camera in your dashboard to make sure you are driving safely? The answer to that question is no. Drivers, while not being watched, are expected to follow the laws and pay attention. Using cameras in the car and invading the privacy of the driver is an unneccasary addition, as there will only be use for the driverless portion of the car for up to 25 mph; therefore there is no further reasoning to begin developing these new vehicles.

If driverless cars are only useful for up to 25 mph, is there really any practical use for them? If driverless cars become the new form of transportation, there will be money involved that a lot of people do not have. Having smart cars requires smart-roads, ones that can communicate with the car to ensure the safest possible driving experience. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" When manufacturers create these smart roads complementary to their smart cars, who will be paying for them? The most likely answer is a raise in already inflated car prices. When the smart-roads are installed, hypothetically speaking, will the road be smart enough to communicate with all different manufacturers types of cars? Will they allow regular cars to drive on them? How long will the instillation take and will it be on every road? These are all things that require time and money. Manufacturers see the big picture of driverless cars running the roads, but that simply can not be the case, given all of the obstacles needing to be overcome and all of the questions that require answers. With all of the money it will require to run cars that are still dependent on drivers, will there be any valid reasoning to spend all of this money on new roads and new car development?

With all of the advancements in technology, there should be a threshold to the items consumers want versus what they need. Manufacturers should not be trying to create new technology, but improving what they already have created. Using driverless cars, still require a driver to pay attention and take control after a certain point, invade your privacy by watching you with a camera, and require more money to create the new road systems and create new cars. In conclusion, I believe there is no practical reasoning that these cars should be further developed. ",6
34f1c56,"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winner-take-all system that? awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    ",6
394b71b,"Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.

Strangley, the author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was ""a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,"" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.

Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa?landforms common around the American West."" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?

All in all, there is no ""true"" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what ""face"" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.

On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa?landforms common around the American West,"" and, "" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.

Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence. All in all, life is changing all around us. New technoloy is being formed, but with a new generation who is ready to show the world what really is in the solar system. The future is in your hands. Find out what is next. Make your mark on the world.                  ",6
3a2b8f0,"The electoral college must go down! The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population. The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system. Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. Therefore, the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country.

Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed? up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This means canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winner-take-all system, smaller states don't get the same oppurtunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any canidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area.

Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population. Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting.

Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system. For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person. Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible.

Using popular vote would be a great and ideal way to decide who is the president during the nationwide election. It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy. Yes, the popular votes is a great and ideal way to vote but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process. Therefore, it makes it clear that having a popular vote to deide who is the winner would be better when it is election time.

Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. Abolish the electoral system college once and for all!       ?    ",6
3b20650,"There are numerous mysteries of the world that mankind is only on the verge of solving.

From Stonehenge to the Great Pyramids of Giza, historians as well as the public has a surplus of both logical and outrageous theories as to where these icons began.

One example of this is the Face on Mars.

The Face has become a symbol of its own and many believe there to be a correlation with alien life.

However, I, as a scientist, am certain that the Face is simply a natural landform rather than an alien creation due to my knowledge that NASA has taken multiple pictures of the formation and reached this conclusion, NASA has no logical reason to hide evidence if it were present, and because planet Earth has similar formations found in nature.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor or MGS image depicted a shocking sight for those down on Earth.

According to ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", an article discussing the mysterious Face, ""...it[Viking 1] spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.""

After their initial reactions, the rational scientists arrived at the conclusion that the sight was in reality, ""...just another Martian mesa"".

They carried on to unveil the finding to the public who some of whom responded claiming the Face is certain proof of Martian life.

NASA has stood by their belief, taking numerous shots of the Face since the original spotting.

As recently as of April 8, 2001; newer photographs using the newest techonology have shown the Face for what it really is.

Jim Garvin, the chief scientist of the Mars Exploration Program, describes tthe intent saying, ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.

We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

The clarity of these recent pictures is much improved upon those shot by the 1976 Viking.

In fact Garvin again claims, ?So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!?

True scientists understand that in order to prove a theory valid, one must utilize multiple data collections rather than one outlier.

NASA has indeed done so in the case of the Face on Mars.

Another reason for believing what I do is the fact that NASA is a professional organization which of course seeks funding and a fair reputation as much as anyone else.

Although many conspiracy theorists claim ""NASA would rather hide"" evidence of life on Mars, this could not be farther from the truth.

According to the article ?Unmasking the Face on Mars?, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

This is completely logical as recently funding for NASA has only decreased, seemingly along with the public's interest in space exploration.

This being the case, why on Earth would it be sensible for NASA to attempt any sort of cover up regarding evidence of alien life such as the alleged Face on Mars?

Finally, to verify NASA's knowledge that the Face is just a natural landform, is the observation which no one can deny: our planet Earth is abundant in formations such as the Face.

In fact, the mesa which the Face really is, is fairly similar to those found on Earth.

These landforms are particularly common is the western region of North America.

In fact, Jim Garvin states, ?It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

That?s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.?

Although Mars and Earth differ is many ways, the two neighboring planets share similar land formations such as these.

The Face is but a specific example of this.

After examining NASA's numerous verification attempts through the means of photography, the fact that NASA has no known motive to hide the alleged ""evidence"", and observing our own planet and its characteristics, it is clear to see that the Face is indeed nothing more than a naturally-occuring landform.

Undeniably fascinating, the Face on Mars is similar to many other wonderous works of nature.

As humans, it is only natural to find these perplexing and interesting.

However, science should not be refuted by simple fascination.

Instead, science should be utilized as a tool to explain the source of these out-of-this-world discoveries.",6
3b755b3,"In the excerpt, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author does not support their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers it presents, all to well, they start off by listing several details that correspond with the exploration of the planet. Such as details of the physical state of the planet in correlation to Earth, but then list the dangers of Venus itself, plans that are backed by science to give human life a CHANCE, but not ideal living conditions on the planet.

To begin, The author starts off supporting their idea of Venus being worthy of exploring by writing about how Venus is somewhat similar to Earth, in the physical aspects, they state the Venus is often referred to ""Earth's Twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" They describe how long ago Venus was, ""Covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth,"" but they do not mention or go into detail as to what happened to the lakes, as a reader I'm curious as to what happened to the planet, and why it is the way it is today. The author also incorporates a description of the landscape on Venus, they write, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as Valleys, Mountains, and Craters,"" the description of the landscape sounds interesting because it is being described sort of like the Grand Canyon, because of the mountains, valleys, and other physical aspects.

Furthermore, the author begins to dive into to the several dangers that go with exploring Venus, they describe the atmosphere as, ""Almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" In my opinion a world with an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide does not sound like the most fun thing. Also being described by the author are the clouds that coat the planet and are filled with, ""Highly corrosive sulfuric acid,"" to me as a reader this sounds more like a death wish rather than a ""worthy pursuit.""

More dangers that the author lists, is the temperature and the atmospheric pressure. ""Temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times higher than what we experience on our own planet. these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarineaccustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans, and liquefy many metals."" Those few sentences do not support the claim and idea made by the author that it would be a worthy pursuit. along with blazing temperatures and crushing pressure come with, ""erupting bolcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

Next, the author continues their ideas with a plan made by NASA, where scientists would ""explore"" by living in a blimp-like structure that hovers about 30 miles above the planets surface. Even 30 miles above the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close the that of sea leavel on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but, survivable for humans."" Being in the blimp hovering above the planet would be pointless due to the atmosphere being so dense that most forms of light cannot penetrate it. also stated by the author is, ""More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" However, the author states that NASA is working on taking different approaches to studying the planet by using, ""Technology called mechanical computers....these devices played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.""

Lastly, the author does not support his/her ideas of ,""Venus being worth of pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" the author does list several benefits and interesting facts of exploring the planet, but unfortunatly in my opinion the dangers greatly outweigh the risks in physically being on the planet. Now if they conveyed exploring the planet from a far, and with robots and not actual people then I would be all for it. ",6
3d098ec,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and does not prove that there is alien life on Mars. The Face was created simply by poor camera quality and an optical illusion. The later pictures of the Face taken in 1998 and 2001 prove this theory even further. If you look at the later pictures, you can clearly see that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation. NASA is also in support of finding alien life, so they would have no reason in trying to disprove that aliens are not real. So, the face is nothing more than an optical illusion, and not something created by aliens.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than an optical illusion and a natural formation working together. If you look at the picture of the Face from 1976, then it is very convincing proof that the face was the work of aliens. However, the picture of the Face that was taken in 2001 shows that the Face is simply a rock formation with shadows where the eyes and mouth should be. This is also proven with the picture that was taken in 1998. Even though there is clouds over the Face, you can still tell that there is no alien creation in the picture. Garvin brings up a comparison of the Face to a ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" which is a ""lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By drawing this comparison, it gives us something we can easily compare the Face to on Earth. People don't claim that the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain"" was created by aliens, yet it is easily comparable to the Face.

Alien life on Mars would support NASA. It would bring great attention to the space program, and more funding. If NASA were to find aliens, they wouldn't hide it from the public. Whenever the picture was first taken in 1976, NASA released it to the public only a few days after it was taken. Although the picture had a theory to disprove that it was the creation of aliens along with it, NASA still released it almost immediatly. This is proof that NASA is in support of finding alien life becuase they were not afraid to release something that could possibly prove it. Even after NASA ended the Viking missions, they still went back to take more photos of the Face. This would either prove the conspiracy theorists even more, due to advancments in technology which would allow for higher resolution photos, or it would prove NASA's theory that shadows were creating the optical illusion. The pictures helped the case of the latter. Because of how much clearer the picture taken in 1998 is compared to the picture taken in 1976, you are able to see much more detail of the Face, and can easily tell that it is just a mesa. Conspiricy theorists claimed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze in the picture, which would later be disproved by the very clear picture taken in 2001. So, if NASA were not in support of finding alien life, why would they release three pictures that could possibly prove alien life?

In conclusion, the face was not created by aliens. NASA is also not trying to hide any evidence for alien life on Mars, so if this were the creation of aliens, NASA would fully support it. NASA released three photos of the Face, all which had the possibility of proving that it was the creation of aliens, yet they still released them. So, if NASA wanted to hide alien life, why would they release anything to hint at it?",6
3d9c7b9,"As a young child peers into the endless night sky from his bedroom window, a bright flickering spot catches his eye and leaves a single question in his mind: ""Is there anybody there?"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about that same bright spot, known as Venus, and explains that studying this planet will real human scientists is worth it despite the many obstacles it raises. By including staggering information of the endless hazards and later reassuring their readers with astonishing facts and likely solutions to survival, the author clearly supports their ideas very well. There may just be a chance for us to see Venus as more than just a bright little star after all.

Initially, the author puts more focus to the first half of their claim as they describe the dangers of this not-so-easy planet. The author informs us that even mighty submarines would not stand a chance in the undoubtably strong Venusian atmosphere; they continue to say that most metals would simply melt under its pressure (paragraph 3). By including such daunting information that makes human life anywhere near Venus seem impossible, it can easily be seen that the author supports that Venus is no cake-walk. Also in paragraph three, the author includes ""additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"" in the background of Venus's already packed daily weather forecast. The author used these earthly disasters and explained how they happen regularly on Venus to prove just how many abstacles there are for scientists who wish to go to the planet, furthure showing their understanding of the idea that putting humans of Venus could be very harmful. Thankfully, exploring this scary planet has its hopeful side.

Near the middle of this passage, the author begins to turn Venus, no pun intended, and the conversation on taking humans there to a more positive angle. In paragraph four, the author writes about how Venus most likely used to be much like the place we currently live; it had amazingly Earth-like characteristics like huge oceans, mountains, and possibly even life similar to ours. With such exciting facts that leave even more questions about the mysterious planet, the author is proving to us that they know Venus has secrets worth uncovering. The author later tells the readers of a plan by NASA to make is possible to harbor human scientists near the Venusian surface by using a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles [above Venus]..."", informing that the situation would in fact be viable for life (paragraph 5). The author showed how they highly agree with the part of their idea that analyzing Venus up close should happen by giving a reassuring soulution from such a well known and trusted organization as support. Exploring our planet's twin seems like it's not such a giant leap anymore, rather, it looks like it will only take a few small steps.

Keeping all of this information in mind, it is clear that the author is a firm beleiver that Venus, although it has put many seemingly impenatrable obstacles in our way, is worth taking a look at with human eyes. If we follow calls to action such as this, we will put the human race just that much closer to understanding the mysteries of the infinite universe around us, but Venus is a good starting point. As a young boy's eyes slowly slide shut, he can still see a tiny flahing light shining through the darkness outside his window blinds; he dreams of the day he can finally meet it.",6
406731a,"The electoral college system has been part of America for many years. At times, this system has proved to be a good thing for our country, but in most times, it has not. I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I am in favor of changing to a popular vote because of the unfairness, faulty aspects, and electors in the electoral college.

To begin, the electoral college is fair in some ways, but mostly not. One may understandably say that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (Posner, 22). The electoral college has proved to be a balance to the political weight of the large states, but regardless of the size of the state, it should be a citizen right to vote directly for their president. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer, 13). This quote shows the unfairness to the voters, those in the smaller/more insignificant states don't even matter because of the electoral college! When voting, citizens also become confused with the electors, and potentially vote for their opposing party. Not only is the electoral college unfair for the voters, but for the presidental canidates as well. We as citizens vote for electors whom we must entrust to vote for the party's nominee. This trust is rarely betrayed, but ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral bote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner, 16). In 2000, the election with Al Gore and George Bush, Gore won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral vote. The people wanted Gore to be the president, but he did not win, due to the unfairness of the ellectoral college.

Another reason I am in favor for the popular vote, is because of the faulty aspects of the electoral college system. A counterargument may be that the electoral college has held our country together, making the voting system a lot easier. But in my opinion this is not true. With popular vote, the citizens would just vote for the president, and whichever canidate recieves the most votes would win. But in the case of the electoral college, states cast only one vote for the entire state! "".. the single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California"" (Plumer, 12). The reason this is such a big deal is because, let's say that 10,000 people voted in Wyoming. 5,001 were republicans, and 4,999 were democrats. The electoral college would pick the elector representing the republican candidate. Thus, Wyoming's vote goes to the republican canidate. Without the ellectoral college though, those 4,999 votes would count, and would go toward helping the desired canidate win. Voting is an individual effort, and the electoral college does not allow for this.

As well as this fault, another fault is the fact that the electors could be anyone. ""They can be anyone not holding public office... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer, 10). Although in most cases the electors vote for the correct party, an elector still may not be trustworthy, or loyal. They may even be bias and vote for a different candidate. The electors do not campaign. Only the presidental canidates do. When we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. Voters normally know little, to nothing about the electors. This makes for an even faultier voting experience.

To conclude, electoral colleges are not the way the voting system should be. With popular voting, there will be an assurance that the right candidate will win, the unfair ways of the ellectoral college will be diminished, and there will no longer be any faulty aspects of the voting system. Citizens vote to be heard, and with the electoral college, the people aren't heard as loud as they should be. Voting is a right and priveledge of an American citizien, and popular voting will ensure this right.    ",6
418f0dc,"Cars have always been known for their efficiency, and speed at which they bring their driver to his or her desired destination. Although, many people are aware of the causes of driving and the negative effects of a car, most never look at the possibilities. They don't know what they are being deprived of due to the simple, solvable problem of driving cars. As countries of the world experience a cultural shift in their daily lives, people are becoming aware of the significant advantages of limited car usage, including lower emissions, increased physical activity, and decreased stress, which in turn would increase overall pleasure.

With a change in one's daily life, the linear relationship between car usage and carbon emmissions, means that as car usage decreases so does pollution. In ""The End of Car Culture,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal comments on the scientific opinion regarding this cause and effect relationship in America: ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Cars are a large contributor to the increasing amount of waste and toxins that make one's air water polluted. Therefore, with a drop in the usage of cars, people and land will be become healthier and cleaner. Emissions are also a problem in Europe where the ""Day Without Cars"" was used to promote ""alternative transportation"" in order to reduce ""smog.""(Selsky) Cars are often used get to specific places such as work or school. So why would two people drive two seperate cars if they're going to the same place? By using public transportation such as a bus or subway, one is killing two birds with one stone by using a smaller amount of gas and fossil fuels to delivery two people to their desired locations, a smarter and cleaner choice.

The limit on car usage has also caused an increase of physical activities within a society. The lack of cars has created the desire for outdoor involvement as Andrew Selsky suggests in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" when he informs people of the ""improvement caimpaign in Bogota"" that has enouraged the ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" Since space is no longer needed for the creation of parking lots, people now have ample room to create the resources needed for activities such as bike riding. Just having things such as trails visible to the public, motivates people to be active. The possibilities of physical activity areas are also encouraged by a change in the transportation bill. In current years, a drastic ""80% has gone to highways"" whereas only ""20% went to other transport.""(Rosenthal) With a decrease in the demand for cars and similiar ways of private transportation, there won't be a need for large highways. Since more money is now available to be used elsewhere, oppurtunities for parks and sports centers are opening up.

Although many may not be aware, a decrease in cars also brings a decrease in stress. This is even hinted at by ""Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza"" when he says ""'It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress...""(Selsky) Although people depend on cars for quick transportation, it can become a hastle when traffic comes into play. It also costs people lots of money when it comes to paying for gas, so an overall reduction of cars would fix all problems regarding stress. As a result of the reduction in car usage, several ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" as Andrew Selsky informs the public in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" With an increase of space to build malls and social places, people have a better chance of staying relaxed and stress-free. Not only do these places enourage relaxation, but they provide a place for one to spend time with friends and family.

From driving hazardous and waste-producing cars to saving money, riding bikes, and hanging with friends at the mall, limiting car usage not only creates a healthier community but provides people with oppurtunities to be better. All around the world people are working to change their daily habits that have created the dirty world one lives in today. Limiting car usage creates an overall happier environment to live in and an endless amount of possibilities.    ",6
43d5bb4,"Computers are one of the best inventions ever made by humans because they have enabled everybody around the world to connect to the Internet. The Internet fuels most peoples lives because of the sheer amount of accessible information about anything and everything. However, should we let computers start making their own decisions? Thomas Huang is the creator of a computer software that allows computesr to read human emotions using 3-D modeling and analyzing muscle movements in the face. At first glance, this appears to be an interesting concept, but there could be several downsides to this type of invention such as overall practicality, implementation in today's society, and even safety and security issues.

First of all, is a software that can read our emotions actually useful? There is potential for this type of software to be used on people for occasions such as a interrogation where the suspect could be lying and the software could detect a quivering lip. On the other hand, this type of software is most likely not going to make it into the homes of the people which presents a business problem. Their solution is to introduce the software into schools to be used for enhancing the learning experience. Dr Huang describes how computers in the classroom could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"" resulting in a better learning environment for the student. The issue is, not every student needs this, and many will prbably disagree with having this software implemented in their school. So, this type of computer software has few areas that it will probably be used causing it to be less practical than it originally seems.

Secondly, how will FACS (Facial Action Coding System) be implemented into a society that is normally unwilling to new changes regarding their technology? People want improvements, but they don't want change. For example, when an application has an update most people update it without giving it a second thought because the newer it is the more likely it will be ""better"" than the previous version. But, when a new phone comes out with plenty of changes people are skeptical and wait for their friend to buy it before they consider purchasing one themselves. So, as a result, people will most likely be skeptical of a software that is able to read emotions because it is something new and no one has any experiences with it yet. This causes FACS to seem like a software that won't be implemented or at least widespread for a long time.

Lastly, will the common person feel like their privacy is being invaded with this new software? For FACS to work the user must have a camera or some kind of scanning device that is able to detect individual muscles. A highly accurate scanning device in the common home will most definitely scare some people out of having this type of software. For example, some people believe that they are already watched through their smartphone camera even though they don't have any form of evidence of such actions taking place. A natural fear of invasion of privacy is part of human nature and cannot be changed. In paragrpah seven D'Alto, the author, mentions that FACS can detect a fake and a real smile which only solidifies the softwares scanning precision. What if someone was talking with their boss using their computer and they lied to protect their job? Although this kind of action should result in that person being punished or fired FACS could use the camera on the computer to see that they were lying and report it to the person's boss or company. Now, this situation is impractical and hopefully it never happens, but the idea that FACS has the ability to use a camera in the home to do whatever they want is scary and will drive people away from using it.

In conclusion, FACS will probably be used for specific tasks only, but it is interesting to ponder the potential for similar softwares in the future. The main problem that Dr. Huang will face is trying to show the people the trustworthiness of the product. If there is too much skepticism from the people it simply won't be found around the world and rather only in more secluded places such as labs or research facilities for testing purposes. In the future, other softwares will be created and maybe they will have the potential to impact the world in influential, innovative, and successful ways.                              ",6
44bca10,"The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth.

Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure.

Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say.

""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more.

A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example.

""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth.

Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""",6
4649f4f,"As technology advances in a very constant and remarkable fasion, many new innovations begin to reveal themselves. While we still might be waiting for the next flying car or teleporter, several smaller, yet very significant, inventions have presented themselves. An example of this is a computer software that is able to identify and recognize emotions. Profesor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the Univeristy of Illinois created this software in hopes of changing the world for the better, but is it really that great? Among the several other practical uses, Huang says that the use of this technology in the classroom can be the most important. Overall the use of emotional recognition has the potential to be useful due to the ability to change the lesson based on mood, and alter mood based on the current your current status, but overall would not be 100% effective due to the spiratic qualities of humans.

Dr. Huang, the inventor of the emotional recognition, claims there could be huge advancements in the education system due to his new technology. In a time of computer screens, video games, and the newest iphone students have trouble beign lectured for six hours a day. Dr. Huang's main goal is to put a computer with the lesson plans and his software in front of a computer so that it can do the teaching, effectivly. If a student begins to get bored and their zygomatic major muscles begin to relax and visibly show the boredom setting in, Dr Huang's computer software would be able to recognize and alter the lesson to be more engaging to the student. This would easily work for many other situations, if a student is sad the lesson could use brighter colors and better diction to create an enviorment where the student is not distracted and wants to learn. Nick D'Alto describes a situation where a student becomes very confused and does not know what they are doing and how to do it, but with the use of Dr Huang's technology the lesson could be changed and break down to easier steps to correctly compensate for the confusion.

Overall, the use of Dr. Huang's software to change a lesson would be very useful in improving the learning enviorment for the students who will go on to create equally as innovative new mechanism in the future.

Secondly, the software can be used to help change the mood of a student in order to boost morale as well as create an enviorment where the student wants to learn. In this day and age there are so many things for a student to be passionate about, such as: sports, video games, friends, and so much more. This is very good in the sense of passion but ultimately takes away from the desire to learn and become successful in school. Often times a student comes into school with the worst mood possible, hating every second of it, but Dr. Huang could change things up. For example if a student comes into school angry Dr. Huang's facial coding system would be able to create an enviorment where the lesson becomes more like a game for the student to play and enjoy while at the same time learning the content.

If a student comes into school depressed, it could be the job of the system to recognize this, notify someone, and help them be happy.

Dr. Huang's invention creates a short cut in seeing how someone feels through science. At times people are too afraid to ask ,""Are you okay?"". The use of this software can go straight to the aiding of someone without even having to think twice. In the end, emotions create roadblocks for students to learn and the use of Dr. Huang's technolgy can identify and help break them down so that a kid can be a normanl kid again.

Although Dr. Huang's software is extremly useful, things can often be a little more complicate than what technology can actually be good for. While the identifying of emotions is very useful, the actual action of neutralizing them can be beyond the machine. For example, if a student is crying their eyes out with no sign of stopping, I am pretty sure a change in the lesson will not help calm that student. If a student is so mad that they just want to break the computer and storm off, no change in the lessons music, colors, or diction is going to be able to fix that. In general an actual human is what each student needs to be there for them. The warmth of a hug or simple hand on the shoulder can change the outlook on a students entire emotional status. The fact that an actual teacher cares is more than enough to allow the teacher to keep teaching. Overall Dr. Huangs software is incredibly useful to identify emotional change but really can not help deal with most situations like a teacher would.

In conclusion Dr. Huang's software holds its value in it's ability to read emotions and alter the lesson as well as alter the mood of a student in need, but is very limited in how it can help a student get through their troubles. The use of Dr. Huang's technolgy in the classroom will definately lead to advances in student comprehension but for the many individuals that need more than a computer for sypathy, the program most likely will not work.

47d8c55,"The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and reallistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the all-or-nothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.

When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?

The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an all-or-nothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.    ",6
4b037f4,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmoshere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town car-free. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completeley true since plug-in cars, hybrids, and other earth-friendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of foosil fuel-powered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives.

4b50f50,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level.

With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned.

Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart.

In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom.

Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!         ",6
4d00492,"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

Yours,

4e9bf56,"The development of a new, self-driving car that functions efficiently is being tested by various different companies, like Google and General Motors, but what practical purpose would this development solve? Some argue that these smart cars would increase traffic efficiency and could facilitate a new age of safe motor vehicles. Others argue that we cannot place our trust regarding safety solely in a machine. The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future.

Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles. Because ""the information from the sensors [of the driverless cars] can cause the car to apply brakes... allow a far better response and control than a human could manage,"" driverless cars may reduce potential for crashes of other incidents. Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development, however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ""driverless car"" being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars.

Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road. As of right now, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This means that someone must always be in the driver seat to ensure safety when the situation requires them to take over. This, however, contradicts the purpose of the ""driverless car."" In addition, because the point of these cars is to drive safely without human control, people could have this in mind while in a driverless car. As a result they may give little regard to the road, and rely on the car to keep them safe and get them to their destination. Then, if they are not prepared for an alert or a need for human assistance, because they expected the car to handle it, their dependency on the car put their safety at risk.

The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, "" who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This could lead to court trials and lawsuits that would either harm the consumers in the auto industry, or the producers. Either way, the costs would have an increasingly negative impact on the economy. It would not be logical to assume that these cars would be one hundred percent safe, as there is alway room for error, and ""presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver..."" Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry.

If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don't need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits. Increased dependency could actually create more safetly problems, and liability issues could result is a crash of the auto industry's smart technology branch. If the concept of this Driverless car were changed to, rather than have no driver, help the driver, then the outcome may be more beneficial. If people still drove the car, but with helpful alerts, warnings, or displays, traffic safety would go up, and the liability and dependency issues would be lessened or dissolved altogether. A new age of technological innovation is here, and utilizing this idea in this moderate waycould pave the road to a brighter future.",6
4f6582d,"While NASA's greatest scientists were working hard in their Jet Propulsion Lab in 1976, an eerie picture appeared on their monitors, as the spacecraft they sent to Mars, the Viking 1, has taken a picture of what looks like an alien-built human face on Mars, though it was actually another basic landform on the red planet. The reason Viking I was taking pictures of Mars was to scope out possible landing sites for its sister ship, the Viking 2. The scientists did realize that this ""face"" was just another common Martian landform, so when they put the picture up, its caption stated that it was only a rock formation resembling a human head. In order to fully prove to everyone that the Face on Mars was just a landform, they even sent the MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, to retake pictures of the area presumed to be the face. They even sent it back for another round of retakes thanks to peoples' suspicions of cloudy weather blocking the view of the face! Thanks to many tests and retakes, scientists have proven that the Face on Mars is just another landform.

While Viking 1 was taking pictures on Mars to find a landing site for Viking 2, it snapped a picture of what appeared to be a gigantic face staring at them like a man staring at the stars with binoculars. Although scientists were very surprised when the face appeared on the monitors in their lab, their sensation lasted only a short time. They figured it was only another common Martian mesa with shadows that only resembled a human face. So that they could get enough hey-everyone-check-this-out popularity for the red planet, they made the image of the Face on Mars public, and the NASA scientists gave it the caption noting that it was ""a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Thanks to this new caption, public attention for Mars, but it ended up dominating people's view on Mars, making them create conspiracy theories rather than convince the truth that it was only another landform on Mars. Despite the people making the Face on Mars a well-known pop icon, it always was and always will be another Martian landform.

In order to prove to the people that the Face on Mars was an ordinary-as-white-paint landform, they sent a new probe, the Martian Global Surveyor, or MGS, to Mars in 1998 to try to retake pictures of the face. The MGS succeeded at its task, as it swayed public opinion away from the idea that the face had to do with alien life existing on Mars at that time. Thousands of looking-forward-to-this web explorers were waiting for the picture to become public, they were also disappointed by the fact that it was a natural landform rather than an exotic alien monument. However, not everyone was satisfied with these results, as they wanted more proof that the face was a face and not a landform thanks to cloudy weather. The MGS did succeed in proving that the Face on Mars was not a face, though more attempts were required to get the idea to everyone.

Not everyone was content with the results of the MGS expedition, wanting to believe that the cloudy weather at the time the picture was taken to be responsible for the lack of the face's visibility. Despite how NASA's chief scientist for their Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, stated that ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" the people wanted more retakes. NASA was able to get the MGS to get better shots of the face in April 2001, and they were able to capture a wonderful photo with the camera's maximum resolution, which dominated the Viking 1's resolution by being nearly thiry times better. Thanks to Garvin's reasoning and the high-as-the-sky resolution of the MSG's new pictures, they were able to prove that the face was only the equivalent of a butte or mesa, both of which were common landforms. Thanks to the MSG's multiple trips, they captured enough well-detalied pictures to prove the true identity of the Face of Mars.

The Face of Mars is only an ordinary landform, and it always will be just another ordinary landform. The scientists began with a caption to the original photo stating that it was a landform only resembling a face, then they sent the Mars Global Surveyor out to try to prove that the Face on Mars was a landform. They also later sent the MGS out again during not-cloudy-at-all weather to let everyone know for sure that the face was not a face. All of these efforts combined let people know how the Face on Mars was not a face but only a landform, but there are likely still people out there who belive that the Face on Mars is still some type of alien relic. Despite how popular the conspiracy theories about the Face of Mars being an alien monument, it was only a standard landform the whole time.",6
5091e12,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to acheieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us. ",6
50d3e20,"Some people are better at hiding emotions than others, but with a recent innovation from Thomas Huang, a professer at the Bechman Institute for Advanced Science, hiding emotions may no longer be so easy. With the software that was recently created, computers can read emotions off of somebody's face. This information is discussed in Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" which talks about many of the aspects of what the Facial Action Coding System can do. Though there can be some cons with this software, they are out-weighed by all of the pros, especially ones found in classrooms. In classrooms if a computer can sense confusion, boredom, or even anger then a teacher can help the student with whatever barriers they are facing.

Classrooms contain various emotions, including anywhere from sadness to rage. According to D'Alto, ""...the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" That can be very valuable for classrooms so the software can read whether the student may be upset and confused, or bored and uninterested. Once the teacher gets ahold of that information then they will be able to help the student and tend to them by their needs. If a student is confused then the teacher will be more likely to be sympathetic and helpful, while if a student is bored then the teacher might give them more challenging work. Although some people may think that the Facial Action Coding System is a phony, it is proven to be otherwise. In fact, it is very well developed and the article states, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Not only has this software been tested many times, it has been constructed so it can read facial muscles and destinguish the emotions well.

Along with the fact that the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers figure out how students are feeling about certain lessons, it also gives teachers more one on one time with students who need the help. D'Alto says that the software, ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When the software does that, it can make a lesson harder for the people who need it or easier for others. Since the lesson can modify itself to the needs of students, that gives the teacher to go around and give help to those in need. Not only can a student get help from their computer, but they can get help from their teacher if needed to. That allows for a student to get two times the amount of help that they could get without the Facial Action Coding System. Some people may disagree with this and think that a computer does not have all of the resources that students need to understand a lesson. Though some people may think that face-to-face learning is more effective, it does not always work that way. In the article Dr. Huang says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... So computers needd to understand that, too."" Every student is different and learns differently. Many times communication is nonverbal and is just by facial expressions. If a computer can understand that as well a teacher does, there is no problem with computers helping out students.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System can help students is because if the students know others are confused as well, then they can help each other out. Dr. Huang says that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" If students start to understand how others are feeling about certain concepts then they might not feel as alone. Some students tend to think that it is only them that do not understand a certain subject or unit, but if computers track and show that even though some people might not look worried and they are, students might feel more united. If they are united then that can help each other out and maybe even build friendships. People may disagree with that and say that not all facial expressions are the same, but, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression,"" they are still universal. While one student might be stressing himself out and have wide eyes, a student next to him might just have his eyebrows furrowed. If the computers identify the differences in actions but similarities in emotions, that can really help students.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in the computer world, and also the education system. If schools took this software into consideration and allowed students to use it, it woud be very beneficial for everyone around them. Kids would get work that suited their abilities and they could get one on one time with the teacher if needed. If the teacher was busy, if the students were able to identify others' emotions from around them, maybe they would not feel so scared to go up to a classmate and ask for help. The Facial Coding System holds many beneficial factors that could help grow the education system and help individual students grow.",6
5190863,"People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is of this opinion. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the rewards of studying Venus and the progress that has been made towards studying Venus.

First, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the many rewards of studying Venus. After laying out the dangers of studying Venus, the author explains why scientists continue to study the planet. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (4). By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied.

Secondly, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the large amount of progress that has been made towards studying Venus. Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. ""Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions"" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality.

In conclusion, the author's opinon that Venus should continue to be studied despite the dangers is well supported by the rewards of studying another Earth-like planet and the advancements that have been made towards being able to effectively study Venus. Scientists have strong motivation for studying Venus, and new technologies are making it possible for them to overcome the challenges presented by Venus's harsh terrain. Although scientists studying Venus are unlikely to encounter any life forms, what they do discover will help them to understand Earth's past and shape our future.",6
5266ddf,"Dear Senator,

The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please.""

(Paragraph 11)

Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

(Paragraph 1)

by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media avaliable, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

(Paragraph 9)

Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""

(Paragraph 13)

This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""

(Paragraph 20)

Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smaller-impact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.""

(Paragraph 14)

A concerned citizen.    ",6
53be578,"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.

There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college!

Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""(Source 3). It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.

""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that.

There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""(Source 3). In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.

56e11a2,"Have you ever wanted to know exactly how somone is feeling? What if you were telling your friend a story and you truly wanted to know if they found it interesting? The latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe can detect the emotions of someone by calculating the way the subject's facial structure and muscles form the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surpries, anger, disgust, and fear. This system is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and can be used for many different reasons. One example is in the cassroom. With the FACS, teachers will be able to read the emotional state of their students, plan/adjust lessons based on the readings, and bring a happier, more interesting experience to the classroom.

The FACS has the ability to read emotions based on muscles and face composition. Tests have been done on one of the most famous paintings in history, ""Mona Lisa"". While this technology can be trivial, as reading a painting-woman's face is not completely productive, it can be helpful towards teachers and students. If the teacher has the ability to truly understand and read their student's emotions, the teacher can switch up and have the ability to try something new. For example, if a student's structure reads that (s)he is confused, the teacher can either go more in depth into the lesson and explain further as to avoid any more confusion. This is exactly what Dr. Huang has predicted, saying that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" in paragraph 6.

Bringing the FACS into the classroom will not only allow teachers to see how bored and confused their students are, it can force the teacher to be innovative and creative in their lesson plans. If the teacher truly cares for their students' attention, (s)he would have to implement new ways to teach boring subjects, in which most students would clock out of otherwise. Most students dread long lectures and usually either stop paying attention, thus wasting both the teacher's and student's time, or forget most of the information. With the FACS, teachers will be able to detect signs of boredom and dread and then capitalize on their emotions with a new activity or fun game to lighten the students' moods, while also giving them the proper amount of information.

Much like the example above, there are ways for teachers to bring a lighter-toned, more fun energy to the classroom with this system. If the teacher sees that the students are boerd, in a lecture for exapmle, the teacher could implement a game or fun activity. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, as explained in paragraph 9, if someone is putting on a happy face, even if they do not mean it, they are subconciously happy and are having a good time. If the students are doing a fun activity together, they are surely going to smile, giving off positive vibes and general happiness in response to an otherwise boring lesson.

The FACS is a revolutionary way of processing emotions and can be really helpful for any student-teahcer learning environment. The system can allow teachers to read what their students are feeling, and can either hcange a lesson plan to reduce confusion, or implement activities or games to increase happiness and positivity during a dreadful lecture. The FACS in the classroom will help both teachers and students alike.",6
57fcfea,"Mapping the Thoughts of Students

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" advancing technology used for recognizing human emotion is suggested for use in the classroom. By having a computer be able to register the emotions of a student and adjust the lesson accordingly using a program called Facial Action Coding System, student productivity will excel, and the stress felt by teachers will ease.

Lessons, for as long as education has existed, have been adjusted accordingly to the audience by the tutors. For instance, a teacher may observe their students leaning forward in interest of the lesson, and may continue based off of that subject. Others may see students slump in their chairs, or watch with glossy, bored eyes, and will attempt to reconnect with the class. Facial recognition is already common. ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day (Paragraph 5)."" But it is done ineffectively in the classroom due to one person teaching twenty others. A computer is unbiased, and only focuses on one body: The user. By reading and calculating the most subtle changes in one's face, beyond what the naked eye can see, a computer is able to follow ""emotion algorithms"" and change the lesson's strategy ""...like an effective human instructor (Paragraph 6)."" The lesson becomes personalized, benefiting the student greatly, as if they had their own private tutor. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (Paragraph 6)."" The student will understand quicker and learn at a greater rate than if they simply sat and listened to an adult stand at the front of the classroom.

In turn, this student productivity will drastically lower the stress and pressure a teacher will feel over their students. Teachers, more often than not, truly care if their students understand what is being taught and want to see them succeed. Teachers, however, do not have the time to focus on each student individualy. By watching a student fail, a teacher feels as if they themselves are failing. With emotion tracking classroom computers, each student has a better chance of succeeding. A student, who has mastered balancing chemical equations, will no longer have to 'start back at square one' with another student who knows nothing of math or chemistry. Students who fall behind more often will be more equal with their quicker classmates. On a whole, the class itself will be more productive, and the teacher may even be able to move on and prepare more advanced lessons. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (Paragraph 4)."" The focus the computer has on the student can be greater, and more effective, than what a single adult can provide. Teachers will feel more at ease knowing their students have the 'attention' they need for more challenging subjects.

Facial recognition is not a new concept, and has existed even before the invention of computers. Efficiency is what has been changing, and for the better. If computers, able to recognize and adapt according the user's emotions, better a student's productivity and reduce a teacher's stress, Facial Action Coding Systems are of great value in the classroom.",6
58b61cc,"While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. While the technology may be able to find the hidden emotions behind the famous portrait Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, that does not mean it is in a position to help students learn. Simply put, the Facial Action Coding System does not have the viability, efficacy, or privacy needed in order to supplement learning.

Even if we allowed camera's to scan the faces of students in school, we would not be able to decode their emotions in a speed befiting our educational system today. At the seventh passage, the author states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful, there are simply too many students for that one computer to process, which would make the entire system useless.

If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.

The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.

Because of the lack of availablity, the potential cheating of the software, and the privacy concerns involved, the Facial Action Coding System is not able to be used in its current state to benefit schools. While this technology could be used in the future to help students, for example students with mental disabilities, it is not able to do so as it is now. It will be interesting to see what this and similar technologies grow to be, for better or for worse.",6
597f576,"The technological age has advanced to the point of being able to calculate the complex emotions of the Mona Lisa, and there's proposal for moving into classrooms as well. However, this is a sentiment that must be rejected wholeheartedly. Despite possible learning benefits, facial recognition technology in the classroom would be ineffective and would constitute an invasion of privacy.

Facial recognition software would be an ineffective addition to the classroom environment. In paragraphs 5 and 6, D'Alto writes of how the computer can sense emotions just like humans can, stating, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" The human body has a natural ability to sense emotions within others by performing calculations based on the subtle body movements of others. Even if a machine could replicate this, as the article suggests, it doesn't dimish the face that humans already possess this capability. No emotion detecting software currently available provides anything that a human being couldn't detect, therefore adding them to the classroom would only be providing information that the teacher could already know. Teachers can detect boredom, stress, and enjoyment just like the computer would, and, if they so wish, they can change their lesson appropriately. Technology that reads emotions would be innefective and unneeded in the classroom.

Software that can read emotions could, in a classroom, invade the personal, privite lives of the students its watching over. Due to the nature of being a computer, the technology could, as stated in paragraph 6, ""'...recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" The level of understanding stops at simply recognizing the emotion; a computer cannot discern the reason behind each emotion because it only detects that the emotion is there. Now place that into a classroom, where students from all different backgrounds are coming together to learn, and there will be some students that have had a rough day. Something happened outside of school that was out of their control, and they're just trying to make it through the day and avoid conversation about it. Sadly, they walk into class, and a computer, which a teacher is giving a lesson, notices that the student is distracted and continually pesters them to pay attention, even though the student's interest is not on schoolwork at all. Life is not contained to just the classroom, and external factors will effect a student's emotion before, during, and after class. Those factors could be incredibly personal, but the technology, not being able to sense anything other than emotion, analyzes this personal part of someone's life as much as it would do a bored kid in class. This is a blatant invasion of students' privacy and needs to be prevented from doing such.

D'Alto argues that the technology could provide substancial benefits to the classroom by creating personalized programs for each student to remain interested, but this process would just prove overall inneffective or exhorbitantly expensive to implement. To provide reason for this technology being implemented in classes, D'alto states in paragraph 6 that ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This has to be looked at in two different scenarious: a group class and a personalized class. For the group class, modifying the lesson would be overall inneffective because it would cause other students that used to be enjoying class to become bored and lethargic, thus prompting the computer to modify the lesson. The cycle would continue until the end of class, with the technology switching teaching methods so often that calling the class coherent would be blatant lying. This modification method would only work if each student had their own computer modifying the lesson. In that scenario, each student would be personally invested into what they were learning. However, it also means that each student would need their own computer that holds this technology. For technology that currently is too complicated for ordinary computers to comprehend, that would require schools to invest exhorbitant amounts of money purchasing new computers that could hold this software. For every student to have a computer would be way too expensive for any implementation to be cost-effective. Despite possible learning benefits, the technology would either be too expensive to be implemented or too innefective to be used.

It's an interesting concept to imagine a world where computers are able to sense emotions and create a personalized program for each person on Earth. However, this imagination is riddled with expenses, invasion of privacy, redundancy, and overall inneffectivity. As the technology age progresses, it's important to remember to leave teaching to the teachers.",6
5a22a42,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) machine developed by Dr. Paul Eckman is turning the tides of facial expression recognition. It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools. Teachers would be able to learn more of their students and improve on their curriculums in order to satisfy the needs of their students. The FACS machine would be able to tell whether a student is lying, needs emotional support and help, and see whether they understand the lesson or not making the machine essential to school life.

When it comes to school, students will not always tell the truth. They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,"" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.

This mechanism is able to determine the emotions of a student and see if they need help or not. It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.

Students may not understand a lesson and are having troubles getting through it. SInce humans find the task of reading emotions diffficult, a teacher may not be able to see this and help the student out but this machine can deal with that problem too. How the machine deals with this horrible issue is state in the statement,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This quote shows how the FACS mechanism would be able to tell if a student is bored which would signal the teacher to modiffy the lesson in order for it to be better understood. Students would no longer have to complain about not understanding their homework or curriculum. This would allow for better grades and better lives for the students in the future.

In conclusion, the FACS machine would be essential to the lives of students in a classroom. Teachers would b able to make the experience of school even better than it is already and easier than it is already. No student would have to struggle anymore which is key to the success of a school as everyone would learn greatly and effecttively. The machine would deal with the problems of whether a student is telling the truth or not, whether a student is in need of emotional support or not, and whether a student needs help understanding the curriculum and lesson that they are learning.",6
5aa769f,"Technology continues to advance as it becomes more complicated, complex, and innovative in today's society.

Just eleven years ago the iPhone did not exist, and yet now we have access to 3-d printers, life-saving medical advancments, and...the Facial Action Coding System?

That's right: this new technology, sometimes refered to simply as FACS and developed by Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, has the incredible ability to read each and every emotion displayed on a person's face.

For instance, the invention identified da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" as being ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.""

While this demonstration of its ability is certainly impressive, we should instead think about the potential that this machine has to be a useful tool elsewhere: such as in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System could be utilized brilliantly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, a valuable idea that could change the way a school is run.

First of all, teachers could use this tool to test how their students react to certain lessons, topics, and concepts.

By using the FACS to gauge the class, they could identify how to modify lesson plans for future units and for the years to come.

As Dr. Huang states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'""

The teacher could access and interpret these results, or the computer itself could ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The emotional information of these students could provide valuable information and instruction that would in turn give a student more confidence and a better undeerstanding of the topic at hand.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System could be used to help pupils measure the effectiveness of not only lessons, but homework assignments as well.

From a student's perpective, homework is the dreaded and unforgiving punishment that one always has to look forward to when one gets home.

If the FACS was used to measure the reactions of kids to certain assignments, the new technology could modify these assignments to better fit the needs of each individual student.

The same topics would still be taught, but not every individual learns the same way, so by using this emotions-reading innovation each student could learn and develop better connections with their current subject material.

Lastly, there are some who might say that the FACS would be useless in helping the learning proccess of a child.

Naysayers could claim that this type of instruction would never work in a classroom because a computer can't provide the same type of personal connection that a teacher can develop with a student.

However, this is exactly what the purpose of the Facial Action Coding System should be; to personally instruct a student based on that child's specific learning needs.

The computer technology itself may not be able to directly teach a new topic, but it can certainly help the proccess by identifying what methods work and which ones do not in a classroom.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is an incredibly valuable tool.

This innovation can pave the way for the future of instruction, setting up a template for teaching for years to come.

Not only could the FACS be used to help teachers modify the way that they present their information in a classroom, the Facial Action Coding System could be used as an additional item to help students with their homework.

While some might say it's too impersonal to be effective, this new technology could truly be the most personal and individual type of instruction that the world has at its fingertips.

In the end, Dr. Huang said it best; ""'Most human connection is nonverbal, including emotional communication...so computers need to understand that, too.""   ",6
5c54427,"With the aging of time comes the advent of new technology. One specific development in this modern era is none other than computer-driven cars. This progression, however, has indubitably raised the question: should we have them or not? While computer-driven cars may cause responsibility issues in times of accidents, ultimately society will experience a higher degree of safety and convenience; thus, it is only neccessary that they be implemented and replace what defines driving today.

Computer-driven or ""driverless"" cars undoubtedly provide more safety to all drivers and pedestrians than cars driven completely by humans. Currently, there are my types of people with the priviledge of driving, whether they be old, young, or even disabled. While the fact that this priviledge is accessible to many seems great, this could lead to disaster; young drivers have more of a tendency

to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol and old or disabled drivers may be oblivious to anything on the road. However, with the advent of driverless cars, those who may not be as strong in driving do minimal work to get to where they want. In paragraph 7, it claims that the ""BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant,"" which is a car that can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. Also, these driverless cars can even ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves . . ."" Lastly, features such as ""flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-ups displays"" are under consideration. With all these new aspects entwined, any type of driver would benefit simply due to the fact that do not have to do as much of the driving anymore. Ultimately, this would indubitably lead to increased safety in society, as both drivers and pedestrians no longer have to worry about performing careless mistakes that would inevitably cause major issues on the road.

Not only would driverless cars increase the level of safety on the road and benefit every civilian, but also they would provide much convenience. In paragraph one, it addresses this notion with ""He (Brin) envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" Today, in many over-populated countries such as China, the amount of transportation on the road is so extreme to the point where car-owners can only drive on specific days of the week. However, with this system of driverless cars, everyone has a guaranteed opportunity to ride in a car everyday. Additionally, this adds convenience to environmental groups and activists due to the fact that, as mentioned in paragraph one: ""The cars

he(Brin) forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Now, with these driverless cars, protecting the environment would become an intrinsic phenomenon. Thus, with the implementation of driverless cars, there would be an undoubtable increase in the level of convenience to society.

It still must be acknowledged, however, that these driverless cars can cause responsibility issues when there is an accident (mentioned in paragraph 9). While this may be the case, it is, in the end, trivial; with new system features mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 7, very seldom will one see accidents. Additionally, this problem of responsibility could be avoided in the first place with the implementation of a recording device in every driverless transport. By doing so, it will reveal if it was the fault of technology or the driver that caused an accident. In the end, this concern of liability and responsiblity is outweighed by its own trivialness and the fact that driverless cars offer much more (safety and convenience).

Driverless cars should be industrialized and ultizied in society in the near future because of the fact they offer maximum degrees of both safety and convience to many members of society. While there lies the concern that driverless cars will cause responsiblity issues when there are accidents involving it, one must consider the fact that these accidents in the first place are seldom to occur; furthermore, this concern can easily be avoided altogether with new methods such as videotaping both the inside and the technology itself to determine what caused the accident.The progression of time has led to the taking of many steps for technology; it is technology such as driverless cars that we must welcome.

6215c79,"In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.

Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible. This brilliant computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" (3). including all major muscles. With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person. Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model ""can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (4). By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person. The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society.

The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials. The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior. Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (6). By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education. The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education.

The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning.

6271110,"The Electoral College is a system that must be changed. It is a system that takes away the people's vote in a sense. As it originated from the Founding Fathers, it is as well an outdated system, that could have a drastic overhaul. The Electoral College could be thought of as ruining portions of this democracy, granting the people to vote for a president. There could be great error introduced to such a way of selecting people for such positions. Therefore, I stand vehemently on the side that the Electoral College must change, granting the people and the government a cleaner, more reliable form of election by three contentions: it removes the thought of there being an improper ratio of electoral votes to popular votes; it is too easy for fraud to occur in the system; and because of how irrational and unfair it is.

The first reason why the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote system is because of how there is such a margin of error introduced in its existence. The opposition may argue that a popular voting system may have equal, if not a greater chance of error, but that is very inaccurate. In a popular voting scenario, things are about as basic as possible. Election results are taken directly from the people of each state, and the results are then combined and compared, in turn selecting someone into office. In contrast, the Electoral College is far more complicated, resulting in more things to go wrong. For instance, a notable example is the 2000 election between Gore and Bush. In this scenario, Gore received a larger number of popular votes, as Bush won the Electoral College. The whole practice of the Electoral College introduces so many variables to the equation, that it would just be very irrational to use such a system.

Continuing, the next reason why the popular voting system should replace the Electoral College is by the chance of ""fraud"" in such a form of election. The members of the Electoral College could be anyone. Now, this may not be thought of as fraud, however it could as well be thought of as fraud of the system. These members of the College could potentially curve the results of an election. For instance, in the 2000 election, members did not stay true to the one candidate, resulting in the possibility for in improper ratio of votes between the Electoral College and the populus. A counter of this argument may be how often this sort of thing may occur. The 2000 election was the first election since 1888 that had a similar problem. However, this sort of thing should never occur. There should never be an occasion of a problem occuring in something as substantial as a presidential election.

My final contention is regarding how irrational and unfair the entire Electoral College is. In this, there is a type of winner-take-all system set in place. This means that, in most states, if a candidate wins the state, they take the Electoral College for the state. Because of this, candidates mainly focus on campaigning in states that they have a clear chance of winning. This is extremely unfair for many voters in the states that these candidates do not even visit. They would have no evidence of what to vote on in election. This could also change an election, with disastrous results. For example, in the 1976 election, a mere few thousand different votes in both Ohio and Hawaii could have led to a tie in the election. Ties are often fatal in the Electoral College system, as delegations in Congress determine a winner of the election. A counter to this claim may be how the winner-takes-all system encourages more campaigning in the toss-up states, where close attention is set upon the campaigning individuals. However, this still does not change the fact that other states are not receiving the proper amount of campaigning to prove a fair election.

In summation, the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote form of election by three previously stated contentions. First, it provides the chance for there to be disastrous results in an election. These results may consist of there being a tie, or an improper ratio of popular votes to electoral votes, as seen in the 2000 election. To continue, my second contention is regarding how there is a chance of corruptness and disagreement in an election. With the Electoral College in place, anybody could technically become part of the College, and there may be a dispute between what member is for what candidate and such. This could be very confusing for the voters. And finally, the entire system of the Electoral College is plainly unfair and irrational. This results in the election being unfair to certain states that did not receive proper campaigning for particular candidates, as it allows candidates to choose which states they would like to take part in campaigning with. In all, the Electoral College is a jumbled, confusing mess of election and governmentation.    ",6
63b8e3f,"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in Lousiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, ""faithless"" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are strawman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a ""winner-take-all"" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, ""..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.."", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The ""winner-take-all"" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests..."", and so having a trans-regional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves.       ?       ?       ?       ?    ",6
667bf45,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Yeah, it might be cool to see how one of your friends if feeling, but at the end of the day, that's their problem. This app could be useful in some way but would you really want to calculate someones emotions? There are three ways that this app is not useful including that the app could not be accurate, it could end up making you lose friends, and how it's none of yout business on how anyone feels.

One way the use of this technology is not valuable, is that this app could be a total joke. There is a posibility that this app could be accurate, like in paragraph 3, it says, ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of phychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)"", but in reality, we really can't know. Let's say you download the app and use it on a friend to see how they're feeling. They put on the brightest smile you've ever seen, and the app tells you that the person is happy. In reality, they're the most miserbale people you've ever met. This app may work, but at the end of the say, no one knows what anyone is going through and this app isn't going to change it.

Another way that this technology ins't valuable, is how it can somehow make you lose friends. In paragraph 3, it reads, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprice, amger, disgust, fear, sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" What if you use the app on someone who you tought was your friend and you found out how they really feel about you. You're going to feel so sad and disappointed in that person that you're going to be mad that you used that app in the first place. Or maybe you make a gift for your boyfriend or girlfriend and you used the app to see how they realy felt about the gift only to find out that they hated it. You would feel upset and possibly get your heart broken even more when they break up with you for giving them that terrible gift. This app really isn't a good idea.

The last way that this technology has no value, is that the way on how others feel, is none of your business. In paragrpah 5, is states, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" That statement is accurate, but no one really knows how anyone feels. Picture this, you have a best friend who you think is the most happiest person in the world, never in a million years would you think they're depressed. You download the app just for fun and use it on your friend to see how they really are feeling, you find out that the're really sad. You try to talk to them, but they get mad at you for being in their business and you come to the conclusion that you did do something wrong, because it was none of your business in the first place. How someone is feeling, is none of anyones concern and this app in an invasion of privacy.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. This app can ruin your relationships and there's a possibility that it isn't even accurate. ",6
6920fef,"With the information the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" covers, this advancement in technology seems extremely unnecessary and could potentially have negative effects even with the good intentions behind it. As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to? Secondly, there was no mention of how much this kind of technology costs or if it would even be plausible for it to be in a classroom setting. Lastly, why is it be necessary for a computer to overtake yet another aspect of a teacher's job of human interaction and communication. Technology being able to read emotional expressions in the classroom sounds wildly ludicrous in terms of use, cost, and personal connections

Although all seems harmless on the forefront of this idea, the side effects could turn very sour very quick. Nick D' Alto says ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.

However if this technology was to be used in a classroom, the next question is of course the cost of such a new computer process. All computers would have to have facial recognition in their system and although there is no mention of cost in the article one can imagine that this new technology is not cheap. Is it realistic to expect that schools will pay great amounts of tax payers dollars just so that we can invade the privacy of our children to figure out if they are bored? It seems much more financially sound to not steal the jobs of millions of teachers and let them get to know their students, opposed to scanning their face.

Teachers are necessary in the classroom not only to impart knowledge but also to make those personal connections that tell them how to best teach their kids. Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom?

In conclusion technology that scans your face to read your emotions has too many ethical questions, financial problems, and no personal connections for this computer process to be acceptable in the classroom. Although this advancement is impressive, the classroom setting is most definitely not the right place for this type of computer process.",6
69654af,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",6
6a28e7c,"A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the ""face"" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.

In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution."" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.

In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,"" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows."" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform."" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,"" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform

Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to ""hide"" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the ""face"" is anything but rocks.

In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation. There was though 3 missions that have evidence showing that it is a landform, there were three different pictures,and there was no reason for NASA to hide this dicovery. The ""face"" is just a natural landform. ",6
6a3b34a,"'Space. The final frontier.' This is a very commonly used phrase that is the helm for space exploration. Since the beginning of time, humans have looked up to the sky and wondered what might be in that vast place above their heads. The problem is, there is simply no technology advanced enough for scientists to explore all that lies around them. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author definitely states the challenges of exploring the planet, but does not effectively support their claim that it is worth the risk.

The author presents the challenge of Venus's inhospitable environment in relation to the Earth by simply laying down the facts, without defending their side. In paragraph two of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the text states, ""Each previous mission [to Venus] was unmanned...since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" The author gives an explanation to the quick deaths of these spacecrafts as well, clearly outlining how hostile the environment is. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon blankets Venus...the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" The author goes on to list more negative attributes, such as the temperature, which averages ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system."" It seems, so far, that the risks definitely outweigh the rewards. The author then describes technology that would help scientists explore Venus, but it is clear that this tech has not yet been developed.

The author mentions ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus"" which is that ""scientists [would] float above the fray."" The problem with this statement is that the technology has obviously not been tested yet, and very likely not even developed. The author's use of an uncertain word, ""possible"", connotes uncertainty and doubt that this idea will even work. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" then proceeds to counter their own argument in the next paragraph: ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"". In addition to listing yet another drawback of the environment, the author blatantly states that the previously mentioned idea would not work for proper exploration of Venus. The author is simply relying on the reader's emotions and assumed interest in space to agree with the author, rather than presenting facts to back up their argument.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does give a couple good reasons for exploring Venus: initially, the fact that it was once the most Earthlike planet. ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" The author then goes on to describe these features: valleys, mountains and craters. Another reason is given: ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration...the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"" It is assumed that the author ends this sound claim with a statement to pique interest, but it does just the opposite. The use of an interrogative relays to the reader that even the author, who is arguing for space exploration, is uncertain how these explorations will be accomplished; this effectively discredits the validity of their statement. The author relies too much on objectiveness to get their point across, and that is how they fail: to propose a strong argument, one must back up their claims with facts to persuade readers, not simply state facts in relation to the negatives of a situation without refuting them.

In conclusion, the author presents a weak argument that is backed up by unfinished projects and an assumed advocacy for space exploration. Rather than give the cold, hard facts of opposition and counter them with more facts that support their argument, the author gives no definitive research on how scientists will go about exploring Venus. The author simply states ideas, accepting them as sound solutions to any problem that space may throw at them. The vast unknown is not something to toy lightly with, lives and multitudes of financing are in the balance. There is no room for possible ideas, one must know with proof that these inklings of imagination will be sustainable when put to the test. Space may be the final frontier, but this argument persuades readers to believe that time is yet to come.",6
6e990ee,"In a school, there are clasrooms upon classrooms that are all teaching different, new, and exciting classes. When walking down a hallway, it is more than possible that the sounds of logorithmic functions could be taught to your left as Shakespeare might be being recited to your right. If you take a turn, one kid may be leaving his photography class to go take pictures for the yearbook while another may be returning from the restroom to go back to her chemistry class where she is studying saturated and unstaurated solutions. Despite the intense differences and varities of classes that there are at a high school, not every one of them is ""new"", ""different"", and ""exciting,"" as used previously to describe the classrooms scenes to all kids. Therefore, if it were at all possible that these kids could feel and want to be more engaged in their classes that take up a large portion of their week and youth, the way to do so should be evident in the classrooms. With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D'Alto).

In the life of someone that is attending school, there is one idea that is always looming over their shoulder. Whether it be like a cloud on a rainy day or a shadow following them on a sunny one, grades are always an important factor in a school-goer's life. Therefore, if this porgram would be able to help kids to be more interested in a topic and be more involved, they may just have improved grades from this system. In the text, the excerpt, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts,"" shows that student's attention could be analyazed. (D'Alto, 6). With this being done, if the computer would be able to recgonize confusion, the student could then be introduced to a better way to learn the material or a way that they beter understand it, then leading to better grades. (D'Alto, 6). Also, the grades of the students could improve based on what the computer decides to do with as much human touch as it can. The passage, ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" shows that there is a solution to any problems a kid may have with what they are learning. (D'Alto 6). The fact that the computer attempts to try and help the students with a human touch shows that it would have the capibilties to do it's best and help the students to learn better, overall improving the student's grades. (D'Alto 6). With both of these examples in mind, it can be seen that the inclusion of this sytem into classrooms would have the capability to improve both a student's grades and understanding.

When a kid is sitting in a classroom for an hour, atleast, every day to every other day, there is seemable reason as to why and how a kid could get easily side tracked and/or bored. Despite this being true, the inclusion of this program into student's lives may have the ability to greatly improve student's engagement and interest in the classroom. In this article, the author includes, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too,'"" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught. (D'Alto 6). Another reason that these kids would gain more by having this system in their schools is the idea that would engage them in a fun manner. When the author included, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can really do,"" the reason is stated so in the text. (D'Alto 6). By including this piece, the author is showing that there, overall, is a fun factor to this could intrigue the students and keep them interested in their assignments and school overall. With these two ideas in mind, it can be seen that, as the attention of students is a primary need for schools, if this could improve just that, there is no reason not to include it in student's lives.

As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology. Therefore, as this is something that is new and up and coming, the addition of this to clasrooms may spark a pasion for this subject and inspire a career to form. In the excerpt, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,"" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,"" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

As kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all.",6
70207b5,"Ever since humans have discovered space and the existence of other planets, the belief that we are not alone in the universe has been a back-and-forth question over the years. It has inspired many works and become a huge part of pop culture. While this can be fun to think about, sometimes people who can't accept the truth take it too far. The Face on Mars is just a natural landfrom because technology wasn't that good in 1976, people (especially conspiracy theorists) take can take things like this too far, and the formation is just like others on Mars and even on Earth.

The original photo of the Face on Mars was taken way back in 1976 by NASA's Viking 1. The spacecraft was only trying to find landing spots for another NASA ship, Viking 2, when the picture was snapped. Technology has evolved vastly over the past few decades, but 1976 was right at the start of this kind of space exploration technology, with the moon landing only happening 7 years prior to this event. When the latest photo of the face was snapped in 2001, its resolution was 10 times sharper than the Viking 1's photo. It showed every crack and bump on the surface of the ""face"", while the Viking's only showed patches of white while most of it was covered in shadow. Even a Mars Global surveyor photo from 1998 (which was taken with better technology than the Viking 1's) revealed a mesa formation. The photos taken after the original in 1976 definitely show anything but a face, which shows that the Face on Mars was only seen because of developing technology at the time.

Everytime there is a statement made by an organized group like NASA, or a government of any kind, people like to try to disprove these statements and say that they are fake. These people are called conspiracy theorists. They usually jump to conclusions on statements like this all the time with little or no evdidence. Back in the 1960s and '70s, the space race had started, causing many people to believe that we are not alone in this universe of ours. Anytime there was a trace of alien life out there, radios would broadcast about it, new channels would cover it, and sometimes even movies were made about these, just like in the case of the Face on Mars. Since these are people's main sources for news, they believed the claims instantly. When NASA revealed a picture of a supposed 'face on mars', the population went crazy. This was solid proof of ancient alien life on another planet, the conspiratists believed, but alas, the only reason this face appeared was due to technology with not enough resolution to snap a high quality picture of the formation. Conspiratists claimed that alien life on Mars would be something that NASA would ""want to hide"", but in response to this, defenders of the NASA budget said that ""they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars"". If the face was actually alien, NASA never would have come out and told the public of its existence, or at least would've said that it was alien in its reveal. Instead that caption read; ""A huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head..."" This shows that NASA directly knew that the formation was natural and most definitely not alien.

The Face on Mars was quite the phenomenon, which started out the belief that there was alien life out in space and also on the planets near to Earth. When scientists first saw the formation from the Viking 1, they were suprised to see a face on the screen, but that was only at first. Scientists quickly realized that the face was nothing more than a Martian Mesa. These mesas are very common around Cydonia (the region of Mars in which the photo was taken). These formations are also on other parts of Mars and even here on Earth. Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River of Idaho."" This shows that a formation like a mesa is super easy to indentify, and one on Mars could just as easily be identified with good enough technology, as proven by the Mars Global Survey spacecraft and the Mars global surveyor from 1998, which was even taken through clouds on the red planet. It makes sense for the formation to be a mesa, especially since the fact that there were no other facelike structures like this found on Mars since.

The Face on Mars is a natural landform because the technolgy that took the photo wasn't that great compared to years after, conspiracy theorists can really blow things like this in the worng direction, and the formation of the face resembles structures like that on Mars and Earth. With our knowledge and exploration of space growing every day, it is just a matter of time until we discover alien life somewhere. The problem is, people can get so caught up in these kind of things and overexagerate them to beyond reasoning. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, so much that we can see every crack and divit on the surface of a planet, so the question is, when will we actually discover a real ""Face on Mars""?",6
716b5df,"The author evaluated their ideas about visiting Venus well in their essay, however, they did have some aspects that could be improved upon. Their introduction lacked a strong thesis which can have a negative impact on the rest of the essay if their claims aren't strongly proven. Despite their weak thesis, their claims made later in the essay were strongly proven. Not only did the author give basic background knowledge of venus and two main reasons as to why studying venus could benefit the human race, but they also gave a solution to the dangers that came with exploring the planets..

In the introduction paragraph, the author didn't give a strong thesis to state their clame. When making a thesis you want to include what claims you will be covering in the essay and what you are trying to prove. The only claim the author gave was in the last sentence of the paragraph where they stated,"" It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" They didn't give specifics as to what claims they will make to prove that Venus should be examined and their vocabulary seemed limited when they used the word ""very.""

Throughout the second and third paragraphs of the essay, the writer gave background knowledge of Venus compared to Earth. This was a good decision because they later used some of the facts that were stated to strengthen their reasoning as to why Venus should be visited and examined. They stated how hard it was to examine Venus and how dangerous the planet was for life. The planet would not be able to sustain human life due to it's harsh terrain and harsh weather. One of the reasons scientists are studying Venus is because they believed that Venus looked like what modern-day Earth does at one point. The writer bringing up how unhabitable Venus is strengthens their argument on why we need to study Venus and their belief that because this happened to Venus, then it could potentially happen to Earth.

Writing about how Venus used to be like Earth and why that's important is a strong point to support the writers claim. When writing a persuasive or argumentative essay, including how what the author is writing about can benefit the reader is a way to persuade the reader to agree with the author. In the essay, the writer talks about two different ways that learning about Venus can benefit the human race. The first reason has to do with benefiting the way that humans are able to survive on Earth. Finding out what changed Venus to become inhabitable can stop the potential for the same to happen to Earth. The next reason they argued, in paragraph 4, was that if something happens to Earth, Venus is in close proximity. One day, the Earth's surface may become dangerous for human life and humans must flee to the nearest planet to survive. The author believes that finding out the exact conditions of Venus and finding a way to sustain human life on the planet would greatly benefit the human races future.

Lastly, the writer gives a solution to the most important problem stated in the essay, that it would be difficult for humans to live on Venus or even visit it. Throughout the fifth and sixth paragraph, the author talks about how research has already been done to find ways for humans to live on Earth. They even provide ideas of the their own for how humans can live on Venus. Pointing out problems with your ideas but then solving them is a strong way to argue your point because it eliminates the question of ""will it fail?"" and might answer some questions that readers have when reading the essay.

Overall, the author argues their points well. The structure of their essay has some aspects that can and should be changed, such as the introduction paragraph. The author showed why their claim was important to the reader and answered the ""how will it be done?"" part of their claim. Answering the ""how will it be done?"" part of the claim can eliminate doubt among the reader and strengthen the argument that the writer is trying to get across to the reader.            ",6
71b6e79,"Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It's not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people's facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.

One reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry""(D'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she's actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.

The final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.

So, the

Facial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.    ",6
721fac1,"In this article, the author presents us with facts about what makes Venus dangerous, and why we should try to study it despite the danger that comes with it. He provides many examples of the harsh conditions of Venus, but is lacking when it comes to reasons why we should continue to study it. Safety is the number one priority in all scientific research, and I don't think this author provides enough reasons why studying Venus is worth the risk. Furthermore, when he does provide his reasons they are quickly proved wrong by himself in later paragraphs, which lowers his point immensly.

The author writes a lot about the challenges of going to Venus, and what makes Venus so dangerous. Yet, he barely provides any information on why it is important to go there. In paragraph 3 he writes, ""...such an environment would crush even a submarine accustumed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" He also writes about the extreme temperatures, 97% CO2 atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and things like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All of these challenges and dangers in one paragraph, and not even one reason why we should face these challenges and go there. In the next paragraph he says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" He also go on to provide more information about how similar Venus is to our own planet, but still, no good reasons why we should spend money researching this planet. When you are talking about visiting a planet as dangerous as Venus, you need a lot of good reasons to go there. However, this author is lacking in his reasons, which makes him sound unprofessional.

Without providing a lot of research, it is hard to agree with what the author is saying. He does not do a great job of proving his point that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In paragraph 5 he writes, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusion landscape."" At first, this seems like a viable solution to the dangers of Venus, and sounds like a good way to safely research the planet more closely. However, it's quickly shot down and is identified as a less than desireable solution in the next paragraph by the author himself. He states facts about how we wouldn't be able to capture photographs from this distance through Venus's thick atmosphere. He also points out that we would not be able to retreive samples of rock, gas, or anything else from this distance. This is the only good possible solution to the dangers of Venus that the author has presented thus far, and he debunks the idea almost entirely in the very next paragraph. This is a terrible way to convince the readers of his opinion; that, despite the risks Venus presents, it is a worthy pursuit to study it.

In conclusion, the author presents more ideas that go against his point, than ideas that acually support it. He does a terrible job of supporting his ideas, and when he has a good point, he quickly proves to us himself that it is not a good idea at all. Taking all of these things into account, we can conclude that the author does a very poor job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.    ",6
722827a,"Emotions and being able to recognize them when they occur have a lot to do with our human ability to learn and pick up information. if perhaps, one is feeling confused, it would be much harder for them to be able to retain information being thrown at them. we see this a lot in the educational environment. At school, students must be attentive and ready to learn before they are actually able to start the process of learning. This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that schools, as well as the education system shoud pay more attention to students' emotions towards subjects, contrasting enthusiasm to pick up a new idea with boredom followed by inability to focus. This being said, the new software being used to detect emotion from facial expressions could be a rather helpful tool in the everyday classroom for years to come.

Every student has a different set of feelings, all are complex creatures with opinions on subjects that could differentiate them from one another. Some are better at learning subjects they are more interested in while others have the ability to devote time into learning any subject that school has to throw at them. The point remaining is that none are the same and so, teaching methods for students should become more indivualized to fit each students unique learning style and ability. It is possible that the computerized Facial Action Coding System could aid in the process of making these learning styles more fit for each student rather than just having them for the masses. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts, 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Having a computer monitor to read emotions from facial expressions could display to teachers how each student reacts to the information that they are learning, allowing teachers to make adjustmants in their teaching styles where they see fit. This could give students the ability to learn more effectively for their feelings towards subjects as they are personalized based on reaction as they continue.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a very complex process consisting not only of computer scientists but also of a team of psychologists using expertise to read peoples' emotions through their faces, using scientific evidence along the way. This could mean that, while it is a newer system, it is a well-proven one, making the classroom a good place to continue perfecting it. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals ofren show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Monda Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Davinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This line from the informative piece displays the process of determining emotions through computer technologies. It shows that it is well-tested and understood by its administrators as well as those in support of it, gaining it credibility as a method tested and used. this means that, while it is a newer technology, it could be used in the classrooms to continue to perfect the software by gaining more facial expressions from students, making it even more effective for its participants.

While the software detecting facial expressions is a good idea for countless reasons, it also has a few downfalls. One disadvantage of this technology could be its lack of other uses besides reading emotions of students as far as classrooms go. Some may argue that installation of this likely pricey software would not be worth the pay or the hassle of overall installation. To this, one could argue that allowing students to have a more personalized appraoch to learning should be enough to convince those against it that it is worthwhile. Students being able to learn in an environment as well as manner specifically tailored to their indivual learning abilities and styles will benefit us as a society not only in the future, as today's current students become tomorrow's important business officials and doctors, but also currently, as these students will have less stress devoted to worrying about trying to learn something they are disinterested in or simply don't understand. Altogether, the good outweigh the bad in this current argument.

Computerized sytems used to understand and display human emotions do belong in today's classroom. The benefits of this approach are numerous for both teachers and students being effected as well as for the future when these students are more outspoken, functioning members of society. This can be displayed that, not only would these systems help students to become more able and excited to learn in their own way, but it would also allow teachers to more effectively complete their jobs by editing approaches to learning to fit each student's individual syle and ability. It is also a well-understood and well backed-up process with scientific study allowing direct research to show its credibiltiy. Having students using this technologuy could also allow for the technology to become more credible as more emotions of individuals are entered into the technology. Finally, the price of these systems would not matter in the long-run as this would be money invested into the future of society as these students grow with a solid, quality education. Altogether, the good outweigh all the downfalls in this experiment and it should be introduced into classrooms in the following years to improve the quality of education.              ",6
734354a,"Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has. Venus may well have also been covered with oceans like Earth currently has. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents through the explanation of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers by his well written explantion of ship hovering. The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, ""...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, ""...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight..."" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits. Although it is not the most persuasive support and idea he displays that Venus is a worthy pursiut, it can still perhaps show how he supports it by giving details. He explains although samples of rock, gas or anything else cannot be gathered, due to the distance, challenges can motivate scientists to progress on more ways to study Venus, to apply more knowledge. He clearly shows his opinion that the dangers should not be limited by dangers or doubts, but should drive humanity to excellence and advancement.

The author's insight on silicon carbide supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursut despite the dangers. Simplified elecotronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chambers. The authors explains it by stating, ""...stimulating the chaos oof Venus's surface and have lasted weeks in such conditions"" (Paragraph 7). He does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. He only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that Venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. He uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear.

The author supports well how mechanical computers would make studying Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. A project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. The author further supports how its worthy by stating, ""...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all"" (Paragraph 7). He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, ""...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin"" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. He believe that studing Venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond. ",6
76ee970,"Everyone shows emotion at some point in their lives. Whether it be joy, sorrow, or even anger everyone has expressed their emotions in one way or another. Now there is a computer software that can recognize six emotions. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom using this technology is valuable because it could tell the instructor when a student is confused, it could modify the lesson, and it could help people feel more empathy for each other.

Students can become confused very quickly when an instructor is teaching about something. This computer software could stop this from happening and overall help students have a better experience at school when trying to learn. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about how this could revolutionize a classroom, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would overall help a teacher know when someone is confused so they can help them after class or talk to them more in-depth about the lesson. This invention could hep out many of students that find lessons to be very hard and don't know how to do whatever the instructor is teaching. This software could also modify the lesson that an instructor is teaching so that it is easier for a student to grasp.

Many teachers present day don't necessarily care if the students are learning what they are teaching, but just the fact that they are teaching it gives them a clear concious. This computer program could give the teachers an alert saying that someone isn't getting the lesson because they are confused with a certain topic that the teacher talked about during the class. They could then modify their lesson so that it is easier for everyone to learn. An example of evidence from the text of this is when Dr. Huang talks about how using this technology teachers could modify their lesson so that it would be easier for their students to learn, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This helps point to the fact that it could help everyday teachers know when their students aren't completely grasping the lesson that they are teaching. This technology could also help people have more empathy for each other.

People present day are always talking about how nobody has any empathy for each other. This software could fix this especially in the classroom. A student would know when their fellow student would be sad and they would be able to talk to them and help them overcome the sadness. Another reason empathy may happen would because we unconciously imitate other people's facial expressions. Here is a quote from this article where the author, Nick D'Alto is talking about how this technology could cause empathy, ""Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This would help people show more empathy for each other. Overall this would be a great addition to the classroom.

Having this software in a classroom setting would stop students from becoming confused from a lesson, help modify the lesson so that an instructor could make the lesson more understandable for students, and give people more empathy. These reason give evidence that having this computer software in a classroom would not only benefit the students but benefit the teachers as well by giving them that peace of mind that their students get the lesson that they are teaching.

7736d47,"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a female student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger female students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this female student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing she is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the female student in a difficult position; leaving her to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now she doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or she tells the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.                        ",6
77cb526,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" or ""FACS"" is not useful or appropriate in the classroom. Paragraph 6 describes that computers basically watch your face to see what ads to use and it could be used in the classroom to see what you understand however, it is not likely that a teacher would want for their lesson to be altered because that can create some problems. Having a computer scanning your face 24/7 could also be viewed as kind of wrong and invasive. On the other hand, if people knew they were being watched, they could easily change the appearance of their emotion. People can be very convincing. Lastly, technology is not 100% correct 100% of the time. Things could always glitch and change things for the worse.

Some might view the concept of a computer scanning your face every time you are in front of its camera as minamally invasive. Everyone has different facial expressions that show different things and it could mean the complete opposite of what the computer views it as. Paragraoh 7 describes that a computer can scan your face to see if there is an ad that you don't like and show less ads like that one. Not only does that have nothing to do with using it in a classroom, but no one likes ads in the first place and you have to pay to get them removed. Also, some teachers like to try and read their student to get a feel of how their day is or see if they're ""living their best life"". While this is sometimes very sweet, sometimes people like to be left alone when they're in a mood. This technology could literally increase the percentage of teachers being in people's business. They already have that Dyknow app that screen records all of our screen so they can see what we're doing at all times, why would they need to know how we're feeling as well?

As an actress and show choir student I can safely say that we, in the performing arts community, can definitely put on a faccade. Others may not be in either of those activities however, people can still be very convincing. Personally, if I knew I was being watched I'd probably fake some of my emotions. People on shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Law and Order"" are paid to put on a fake face. Their job is to literally be fake for a camera. There are episodes of those shows where people are crying and they look very pained. Chances are, they are not really feeling those emotions. Arizona Robins may have cheated on Callie Torres but Jessica Capshaw didn't cheat on Sara Ramirez. That's fake emotion. They might not be it their character is so they have to play that part and be convincing or they don't get the part. In show choir there are songs where we have to be angry and then suddenly happy and then concerned all in a matter of sixteen counts and if we can to that then we can change how we portray our emotions when we are being watched by a camera.

There are so many different applications and softwares tha are in the world now and no matter how advanced the technology may be, it is never always perfectly running. Even the latest technology glitches from time to time. Technology is constantly updating and changing due to bugs in the software. Technology like this could ruin something completely. Everyone has a focus face that they put on when they're reading something or solving an equation. Let's say someones focus face looks a little bit angry. Just because their face looks angry does not mean that they don't like the question or don't like how it's taught or explained, it just means that they're focused on what they're doing. If the software misreads a facial expression and changes what's on the screen it could completely mess up what the student is doing. Or if the student does need the way of teaching adjusted and it does change. it could cause problems with the teacher because some teachers want things done a very specific way. If something happes with the software and it could inconvenience the student in many ways.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System should not be put in classrooms. IT's not completely useless, but it it's not very useful either. People don't need their face read to see how they feel about an ad or about a teaching style, that's why surveys were invented. If someone wanted people to know hwo they felt every time they turned on a computer, they'd start a blog. There are really bad actors on this planet but there are a lot of liars and pretenders. If a lot of people knew they were being recorded and faked a smile because they think that their privacy is at stake, it would completely defeat the purpose of the system and it would all be for not. Technology is also very expensive these days and this type of thing can easily be hacked or it could glitch and once again, defeat the purpose of the system. ",6
79dfcd7,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I believe that the way our elections are run are not what is best for the United States. The Electoral College is changing the way that we originally set out to vote and is making things unfair for the citizens who vote. I propose that the Electoral College is taken away all together in order for elections to be more fair, and more like the original intention of the U.S. With most states following the winner takes all idea, the winner of the general public may not be the candidate that wins the elections. These times are rare, but they happened before there is nothing that is stopping them from happening again.

A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election.

Another reason that this process is so unstable is the way that it makes voters feel about voting. In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.

Some argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the Electoral College is a far more organized way to conduct the voting. But every vote counts, and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite. It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it?

I think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an Electoral College to the idea that all of the people in the United States are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right. Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College.

There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Citizen    ",6
7c87818,"Growing up in a constantly changing environment, students have had to learn to adapt to the world around them. In school, students are taught to be open and ready to learn, while still facing the ups and downs in the journey of childhood to adulthood. Students make close bonds with their friends and even a few choice teachers. Students choose to whom they share their emotions with and at what time they wish to do so. Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous.

This technology is incredible. It's capable of easily figuring out what someone feels right when they're feeling it. Empathy is an intimate ability one experiences with another. Most people have the ability to sense others emotions, ""For instance, you can probably telll how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" There is a prominent understanding in the natural world regarding emotions. Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers. In school, students are faced with one major task: to learn. Teachers are faced with the task of teaching. A teacher's job is to engage students and the students job is to stay engaged with the teacher. Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon. Teachers and students have major jobs to do at schools and this technology might distracted from the main goals of schooling. Students want to be cared about and valued but not by everyone or at any time a computer chooses. Students may feel uncomforatble if teachers ask how they're feeling. A student has friends and family to confide in, and may not want everyone to know the personal and private issues they are going through. If students emotions are displayed to their peers and teachers, they might feel awkward opening up, because they aren't comfortable around them.

Furthermore, this technology could be used in the wrong situations. The article stated that a smart school computer could tell when students are getting bored or confused and change the lesson, ""' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This example puts teachers in an awkward position. Letting a smart, facial reading technology teach students would mean the teachers aren't teaching. Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. This technology had the purpose of connecting humans in focus but instead it will further divide them. Students don't want to be analyzed by computer systems; they want to be cared about by other humans. If the goal is to focus on students emotions, adults should take some time out of the day to talk face to face, instead of sticking the child in front of a computer monitor.

Some might argue that these computers might be a useful tool for counselors in schools. This is a valid argument, but this also compromises the position of school counselors. Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection.

The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction.",6
7cd65d1,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying our sister planet is worth the risks and dangers it possesses. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" or the ""Evening Star"", Venus has proven many times that exploration is close to impossible for spacecrafts, let alone humans. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". This sentence in paragraph 2 already shows signs of uncertainty in the author's claim. Although the author mentions that Venus may instill curiosity in humans, the dangers and inhospitable conditions that he also mentions contradict the point he is trying to get across.

Throughout the entire passage, the author provides both negative and positive facts about the idea of human exploration of Venus. Although providing negative aspects might be his idea of a counterargument, the bad outweighs the good in this scenario. ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (paragraph 3). This statement, full of reasons not to explore Venus, provides a contradictory tone and idea. The author even starts the sentence with ""Beyond high pressure and heat"", which demonstrates the fact that he is adding on more negative aspects to a previously mentioned negative aspect.

The uncertain author also mentions that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"". This piece of information alone defeats a large purpose of exploration: getting photographic evidence. ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". This statement also defeats a huge purpose of exploration: getting physical evidence. Without this ability, scientists would have to get very close to the surface despite the risks. One things that the author mentions to support his claim is that the risks should be thought of or seen as challenges. This change from a negative word to a positive helps to support his claim and provide insight to his passionate opinion.

The author mentions more cons than pros, but he seems to stick with his claim and brush off each negative in the last part of the passage, paragraph 8. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited to dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This concluding statement shows that the author is urging humans to be fearless and hungry for exploration and innovation. The author also believes that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" anyway. Although this claim sounds more like an assumption, he is trying to show that if humans can explore other dangerous areas of Earth and space, then they can also overcome that obstacles that prevent them from doing the same to Venus.

Although the author mentions that Venus may instill curiosity in humans, the dangers and inhospitable conditions that he also mentions contradict the point he is trying to get across. All in all, the author fails to fully support his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents. The facts and evidence prove his claim wrong, and he only provides an inspirational conclusion to create a distraction from the reailty of the situation. With the author providing facts like spacecrafts surviving only a few hours and frequent natural disasters on the planet, he tears down his own claim and gives more reasons as to why this exploration cannot work than why it can.",6
7cf67d3,"When a student is confused in school they are supposed to raise their hand. It's been taught that way since day one. Whether that is followed or not is hard to say. Some students are scared to raise their hand however, as they grow older and mature, they seem to find more courage to ask questions which is the way it has always been taught. Students generally make faces when they are confused, that can be beneficial to the teacher if they're paying attention. A recent computer software has been developed by Professor Thomas Haung that indicates peoples emotions. It was used on the Mona Lisa to get every percent of each emotion on her face. It was suggested that this software be put in schools to benefit students. However, this innovation should not be put into schools because of the varying ages of kids, how much it would actually be used, and the convienence of the schools budget and space in the classrooms.

This computer software that can tell every percent of what emotion on your face is a very fascinating concept but is not the most convienent for pre-school and elementary students. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it was said a classroom computer could recognize confusion or boredom from the students and then in which change the lesson for a more beneficial class (para 6). If this were to be put in place into an younger classroom it could be misleading. Younger kids have spunky behavior as their minds are still maturing and developing. They might find the software fun and amusing and make many facial expressions which would alter their lesson plan in class unaccordingly. Others may argue that little kids could possibly get bored of doing that every day and eventually calm down about it so then it would be useful. Though you never know when a little kid could find something fun again, it's just that easy and would then again rise to misleading lesson plans for the young students.

If this technology was put in a highschool classroom where students minds have better matured and developed it would be more successful. However, there would need to be a computer for every student and not all schools can provide that.

Some students may even find it uncomfortbale to have their expressions and themselves being watched and analyzed all day. As a result of knowing they are being recognized as confused, they could easily act and prevent their expression from giving that result or not even use them. People can already do the work of this software, friends can tell how you're feeling based on your facial expression (para 5). Also mentioned in ""Making Mono Lisa Smile"" people use their knowledge to tell whether a politician or celebrity is faking a smile or being truthful (para 8), again proving that people can already do what this software is, just not as precise with numbers. On the other hand, if these computers were installed in schools and became a regular thing, then it could eventually be excepted by students and they would actually use the software to their benefit.

Teachers would find this innovation helpful. They could argue that not all students express if they trully understand material or not. If they had this software it would accurately show them the truth about their students. But students could still refuse to use it which would lead teachers back to square one.

Maybe even before a students first day of school they were taught to raise their hand if they had something to say, it's normal. So let students do that because the computer software that tells every percent of every expression someone is having is unecessary to have in a school because of the varying ages of kids, how much it would actually be used, and the convienence of the schools budget and space in the classrooms.",6
7e6f8db,"To Whom it May Concern:

The Electoral College is the cause of many political disagreements and problems whenever mentioned. Although established in the constitution, it is seen as undemocratic by many. The Electoral College takes away the ability of citizens to vote for their president; instead they are voting for Electors, not always loyal to the canidate. As a result, I believe the Electoral College should only be used in instances of a tie between two canidates.

Each presidential canidate has a group of Electors, which will be part of the Electoral College process after the popular vote is taken. The Electoral College proccess consists of the selection of electors, the meeting in which the vote for both President and Vice President occurs, and then the votes are counted by Congress. (Office of the Federal Register)1 When the popular vote occurs, and the canidates are selected, the votes are tallied, and then the electors of the two canidates attend the meeting, and then the final decision for President is made. This is viewed as undemocratic, because there have been instances where the Electoral College dissagrees with the popular vote. Such as the case of Al Gore in 2000, who won the popular vote, and then lost the Electoral vote and therefore his presidency.(Bradford Plumer)2 This caused over 60 percent of voters, to wish for a direct election opposed to the electoral proccess, according to a Gallup poll, also occuring in 2000. (Bradford Plumer)2

Anotherr issue within the electoral college, is the electors themselves. While they may claim to be loyal to their canidate, loyalties can be bribed, changed, or electors may even be replaced with only a certain party (Republican or Democratic). Which occured in Louisiana in 1960. The segregationists almost replaced Democratic electors, with ones who would instead oppose Kennedy, as a sabotage attempt at Kennedy's Presidency.(Bradford Plumer)2 There have also been cases in which the loyalty of the elector was switched, and the citizens were seemingly forgotten at the electoral college. While there are over millions of people residing in the United States, there are only 538 Electors, and the fate of our country is put in Electors who can't be trusted.

Over 60 percent of Americans oppose the Electoral college, but there are still some which still believe in the compromise established by our founding fathers. The Electoral College provides a smaller chance of election ties, and an equal vote from each state. While a tie is possible in the popular voting system, it is also possible in the Electoral College, with 538 electors, 269 votes from each side can cause a huge dissagreement within our Legislative System, which could be avoided by using only the popular vote. When politicians and presidential canidates are looking for votes, they most commonly travel to the larger states, because of the larger population. A larger population provides an even larger chance of obtaining voters. But, this leaves the small states with no attention from canidates, and a smaller population weakens the states chance of the canidate they desire. Every vote counts for a canidate,5,559 voters from Ohio, and 3,687 from Hawaii stopped a tie by voting. (Bradford Plumer)2 Even the small states contribute in a presidential elections, their votes are just as big as ours, even if their states ae small.

The founding fathers formed the Electoral College as a compromise, and hundreds of years later, I believe it is time for a compromise once again. The popular vote, should become the deciding vote for who is elected as President, Vice President, etc. With this, the chance of a tie comes, so i propose that the Electoral College remain only for the purpose of a tie in the popular vote, or if state legislature has reason to believe this canidate is not the best for America.

7f17066,"America: land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democtratic electors? chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occured in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exeption. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leade, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this resposibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the 'thoughtful' voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winner-take-all rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.       ?    ",6
7fe2d12,"To the state and the state's country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote. It must be changed to meet the needs of giving a responisble president, a more trustworthy election and the votes cast must be directly towards him rather than the electors. In other words, the Electoral College must be changed to become more fair towards the citizens.

The United States Of America, is of course a massive country with large variations of different needs. All over, there are people who vary in opinions, beliefs and lifestyle which can cause the Election of the president to become an important subject matter. To meet the needs of so many people, instead the Electoral college must not choose a president that takes up space, but instead have a right mind to be responisble in taking charge of the country and the people.

There are many reasons why a responsible president must be choose. Things like creating rules to attend the needs of all citizens and create equality amongst them, to keeping harm from out of reach, the Electoral College should become much more wiser in choosing the right ruler to take control. In the article

What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text

In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.

The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as ""Winner-Take -All"" due to states titled as the ""Swing States,"" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.

There is very little equality when it comes to elections especially, when the states are giving an unreliable system to choose for them. States that are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded the system named ""Winner-Takes-All"" due to how they apparently pay closer attention to the campaign. In the article

What Is The Electotal College by the office of the Federal Register, the method is first introduced in paragraph 7. Stating that the purpose of the ""Winner-Take-All"" system is not only,but to award all electors to the winning canadidate. It is said to be unrelaible and untrustworthy due to it's focus on states that appear t have more attention towards the election. On a more basic level, some states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina had not even witness the campaign and even leaving a few voters to have no say. Going back to the misunderstanding of the election of Romney,the country wittnessed an iresponsible canadidate that had ran for president. With the unreliable ridiculous system ""Winner-Take-All"" some states may or may not have even experienced how Romney had acted and his intentions towards the elections and the campiagn. With very little knowledge of the presidential canadidate and with limitations of voting and campaign ads, there is very little trust given towards the election process especially with more than a few states that are not being taken very seriously, with very little say. If the Electorial College could give off more information and more become more reliable towards all states, the process would be less sinister and more apreciated.

There are many more other factors in which the Electorial College must be changed to meet the appropriate dilemas and needs of the voters and their intentions towards the campaign. On the other hand, it has not changed at all only to stay unfair towards the entire country and possibly cause a catasrophe.

Let us say, there have been many incidents where elections have been on the edge of a major dilema. Wondering why a straight up orderly process can go to the point of a catasrophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.

All can be simplified in the article

Why Even The Best-Laid Defesnes of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, states back to the disater factor of the election of John F.Kennedy. It states back to the 1960's where faithless electors had pushed aside the votes and sayings of Louisiana had decided to vote for whomever they had wanted. It had caused a problem of course since the votes where not even of the people, but of the selfish sick minds of the electors who toke the process into their own hands. In the same paragraph it staes back to when the state of Hawaii had sent in two slates of electors to congress. With the unreliable actions of Richard Nixion,? had validated his opponent's electors of course to win over the campaign. once again another issue arises in the article

Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President, it agrees with the unfairness of the electorals by giving the example of how the Electorial College had turned off the potential voters due to the knowledge that their votes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, it states that in the state of Texas, it was known that the votes would have know effect of the campaign what so ever. It aslo had staes that voters in politcal elections have no care rather than to express the political refrence than what the peole think or decide. This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust.

In conclusion, the Electorial College mut be changed to meet the need of those who agree that is it irresponisble when givng a repsonisble president, a more trustworhty election and an unfair process. Yet this can all be fixed simply by changing the ways it is run and to give more freedom for the people.    ",6
80b646c,"Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. Studying Venus is a terrible idea because technology isn't advanced enough, it would take years to discover anything beneficial, and the costs' of this, both in money and lives, are outrageous.

Technology throughout the world has improved since the 1900's,however, it has improved on Earth and in regards to Earthly tasks. When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion"". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but ""survivable"". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.

Exploring unmarked territory isn't something that can be done over night. Unmarked territory is exactly what Venus is. Even if technology did evolve enough so that humans could visit this planet, it would takes years, decades, even centuries, to accomplish. In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving ""what if"" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.

Assuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, "" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.

In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.        ",6
822982a,"The presidental elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the Electorial Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the Electorial Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the Electorial Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jepordize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system.

To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the Electorial Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campains and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says "" If you lived in Texas, for inatance, and wanted to vote for (John) Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty-four electoral votes. Who are the electors?"" amd in source 1 it says ""THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise."" But honest is it really a comprimise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn't live up to American values.

Another reason that you shouldn't support the Electorial Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jepordize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidental elections you can't, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves.

The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the Electorial System is because of the ""Winners take all"" system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all."" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote.

However even in the midst of all that wrong with Electorial System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don't know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's even a lie. We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?

To reiterate the bottom line is that these Electorial Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.    ",6
8230435,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved. The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus.

First of all, the author immediately combats the argument of Venus being too dangerous to venture. When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.

Furthermore, the author heavily emphasizes the learning opportunities that exploring the foreign planet would undoubtedly provide us. While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.

Finally, the author provides numerous options being developed for humans to embark in safe and efficient travel to Venus. When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.

Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.",6
833118e,"Many students take their own charge in school, but that often means they hide important information from others; for instance, when they are not sure about something or when they are tired and find it hard to focus. These types of situations are hard for schools to deal with. However, there is some technology that could help. Made by Dr. Paul Eckman, the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) uses major muscles in the face to calculate a person's emotions. This technology has been used in many places, but one of the big places it could be used is the classroom. As long as it is used right, the Facial Action Coding System could greatly improve student interest, focus, and clear up confusion in different lessons. The uses start with student interest.

School often is not the most exciting place in the world, especially in higher grades. The biggest argument for this is that ""they don't need interest in what they learn, they are adults."" However, that is not completely true. Anyone can become uninterested in something, and it can impact how much effort they put into it. That's where the FACS comes in. It could recognize when a student is uninterested in something and find some way to fix that. Ways to make something interesting vary by student, so building a plan and relationship with the student is an important part to making it work properly. Some people will likely say that doing this is way more work than it should be for something so small, but they do not realize how big that actually is. Everything a student learns is going to impact their lives in some way, and it's a school's job to make sure this sticks with the student. If it does not, who knows what will happen. Make sure to remember that uninterest isn't the only way a student can lose what they are supposed to get from school.

With students having to wake up early and do homework almost every day, it can be hard to get the right amount of sleep. This can possibly lead to a lack of focus if what the student is learning in school is not engaging enough. Many people could call this a lack of focus. Losing focus in the middle of a class often leads to forgetting almost all the information from the class that day. If we could detect drowsiness in class, the information could be used to try and talk to the child about a better sleep schedule. If communication with the child on this front wouldn't be possible, the teacher could try and find some way to increase interactivity in such a way that increases focus for most students in the classroom. One common argument I've seen against this is that it is an unnecessarily annoying affair, but there's nothing really backing this up. As long as it is implemented correctly, any major annoyance can be avoided. Both of these first two reasons had a lot to do with the student personally, but sometimes it has more to do with the lesson and how understandable it is.

Confusion is a strange mix of anger and sadness when a fact or solution cannot be understood properly, or a different fact or solution was understood before and a new fact or solution is taking its place now. It is a common emotion in schools, and could be avoided easily with the FACS. When the FACS detects that a student is confused, the content is broken down for the student in a way that is easier to understand. The content can be delivered at the student's own pace, in an attempt to keep the student from getting even more lost. A system similar to this could save many students from getting bad grades. Now someone is probably saying ""Why can't the students ask about the problem when they get confused,"" and this is a very good point. However, it is also an easy point to shoot down. Many students find the prospect of asking questions scary, especially with the idea of a ""bad question"" or ""stupid question"" and personal embarassment. With this idea in place, they wouldn't have to ask publically or get shamed by the teacher for not understanding the subject. Instead, the entire proccess could be private. It would eliminate confusion in many subjects.

And so, with the elimination of confusion in the classroom, the increase of focus during lessons, and the implementation of systems to increase student interest, the FACS could be a lifesaver for many students in school. However, with the cost of implementing such a system likely being outrageous, the chance of this being implemented is low. Nevertheless, we can always try.",6
860b60b,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives readers details on how Venus is Earth's ""twin."" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in both size and distance. The author discusses with readers why scientist want to explore Venus and how they are taking the steps to do it. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how humans have the technology, why exploring Venus is important, and by informing readers on the dangers of exploration.

First, the author supports their idea that the danger of exploring Venus well by explaining how humans do have the technology to explore Venus. The text gives examples of many advancements that have been made in order to explore Earth's sister planet. The author writes, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This quote shows that the author's idea is well supported because it gives an actual example of the technology that has been created in order to explore Venus. Space exploration has been advancing and improving for years, so eventually humans should be able to explore planets with the worst conditions easily. Another way that the author's claim is supported is when they discuss that the technology needed has been around since before humans even traveled to space. The text discuss a device that has been around since the 1800s and played a significant role in World War II. This goes to show that humans have more than enough resources to travel to Venus no matter how dangerous it may be. In all, the author supports the idea that exploring to Venus is worth any danger that humans could face well by giving information on the technology that humans already have to do it.

Secondly, the author supports their idea that going to Venus is worth it because they discuss how important it is to explore Venus. The text discusses that out of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like Earth. The text reads, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth."" This quote displays that the author's idea is well supported because it tells the readers how important exploring Venus is. By studying Venus, scientist could learn more about different forms of life. There could have been different plants and animals on Venus then there is now on Earth. If scientist were able to figure that out, it would be an amazing discovery and could improve the world's knowledge on space overall. Furthermore, the author talks about how much more convinient it is for humans to travel to Venus. Since space travel can take years, Venus is one of Earth's only options for exploration. So, the author's claim is well supported because they talk about how significant the exploration of Venus is for science.

Finally, the author's idea is well supported because even though they support the exploration of Venus, they still discuss the possible dangers of Venus. It states repeatedly in the text that Earth's conditions greatly differ to Venus's. The text says that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This shows that the author's claim is well supported because they are acknowledging the fact that the exploration of Venus is not an easy task. Sending humans to Venus can be a fatal misson, so it is a good thing that the author can explain that, while still supporting their claim. Another way the author shows the danger of exploring Venus is in parapgraph three when it reads,"" These conditons are far more extreme than anything the humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This shows that the author's idea is well supported because they still acknowledge the fact that going to Venus is extremely danger for both humans and any sort of machine. In summation, the author's idea is well supported because despite the fact that they are for the exploration of Venus, they still informed the readers on the dangers.

Consequently, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their idea that exploring Venus no matter the dangers well by explaining how humans have the technology needed, why exploring Venus is important for science, and by informing readers on the dangers of exploring Venus despite the fact that they believe that it is worth the risk. The author of this text informs readers well and has an open mind while writing since they did explain the dangers. The readers can form an opinion on this subject since the author both dicussed how exploring Venus is important and how it may be extremely dangerous to explore. ",6
86f807f,"In ""The Challeneges of Exploring Venus"", the author claims that the obstacles that stand on the way of studying Venus should not be the reason why scientists don't explore it. The author is not consistent throughout the article and does not present solid information or evidence that convinces the reader that exploring Venus is worth risking lives.

The author begins the article by comparing Venus to Earth and says that both of them are similar both in density and in size, but then moves on to stating that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decadaes"" (paragraph 2). After that statement the author lists all of the dangers that would come with exploring Venus: ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus?s atmosphere. On the planet?s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (paragraph 3). By that point the author has made clear that Venus is incredibly dangerous and that studying it means sending researchers to an highly risky zone, and may result in devastating failure.

The contraditiction begins as soon as the author begins to explain the reasoning behind even considering visits to the planet's surface. By that point, the author was using real data and solid information to explain the dangers of the planet's surface, however, as soon as the author started reasoning on why the expedition should happen, his arguments were not as solid and were based on assumptions: ""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(paragraph 4). The use of terms such as ""it may well once have been"" or ""was probably"" do not give the reader the confidence that they need to believe in the author's claims, that is based on ""probably"" and ""most likely"" expressions.

By the end of paragraph 6 the author even writes about his own contradiction: ""Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" Such passage shows the reader that even the writer doesn't seem to believe in this mission and that the author needs to keep telling himself that the risks of sending someone to Venus are, in reality, simply ""challenges"" that need to be overcome. After explaining NASA's work on other approaches to studying Venus, the author actually refers to Venus's surface as chaos, and then concludes the article by claiming that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (paragraph 8), a claim that contradicts previous statements made by the author himself.

In conclusion, the author contradicts himself a series of times and does not present nearly enough evidence to support his main claim. By using expression such as ""was probably"" to explain the history of Venus and why NASA should explore it, the author creates a statement based on assumptions and not based on real data. Claims that Venus is a very challenging place to examine closely are consistent throughout the article and the author never discredits them, on the contrary, he reinforces them. With that being said, the author is not consistent and does not make valid claims or statements that make the reader feel the need to support explorations and studies on Venus.",6
8831d7a,"In ""The Challenge of Explorig Venus,"" the author does not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers prevalent on the planet. The author uses poor diction in supporting his idea and does not provide enough evidence for ""why"" but instead provides numerous examples on ""how"" humans would study Venus.

Firstly, the idea of rising up to the challenge to explore a wonderous planet is nice, but the actual rationale behind it unfortunately does not hold the same wonderous value. The author points out in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth'like planet in our solar system."" Astronomers curiousity of a planet that could have possibly been similar to Earth is not worth millions or billions of dollars which could be used elsewhere. Simple fascination and speculation is not an incentive to spend that type of money. Humans should perfect spacecraft that will be sent into space before shelling out millions of dollars for very little information. The answer seems to be clear. The price simply outweighs the ultimate gain of exploring Venus.

Contrary to what would support the authors claim to pursue further exploration of Venus. He includes various backdraws of exploring the planet. The article states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degreees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. hese conditions are far more exterme than enaything humans encounter on Earht, such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and wuld liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

All of that mentioned in the paragraph are reasons why humans should not pursue further exploration of Venus. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases, clouds of sulfuric acid, an average temperature of over 800 degrees, atmospheric pressure strong enough to crumple a submarine like a soda can, erupting volcanoes, and frequent lightning strikes. So in essence the danger alone should dissuade anyone from even attempting to visit Venus.

The author goes on after his brief reasoning to explore Venus to give an example of how one would explore the planet. He states,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray... a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape... temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans... peering from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mos forms of ligh cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" It is presented once again that exploration of Venus would not only be dangerous, but will ulltimately prove unfulfilling in terms of gathering information. The author uses words such as: 'ineffective"" , ""survivable"" , ""not easy"" , and ""limited."" All of which refer to the study of the planet. None of his examples show some sort of positive aspect of exploring Venus.

In conclusion while the author's idea that exploring Venus will give new insight, and better our overall ability to understand space as a whole it is undeniable that exploration of the planet is simply not worth the risks, dangers, and costs presented by evidence in the article.          ",6
904ff51,"My fellow citizens, allow me to make an urgent announcement. Stop with the constant use of cars. It's damaging not only us, but the environment. We live in aworld where cars are now becoming a major trend, and we're driving them more and more. If we keep drawing that pattern, we won't have a stable world to live in.

I'm not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I'm saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In 'Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog' by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it's polluted cities. Duffer shows us how ""the smog"" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding ""smog."" We can't allow ourselves to become the most polluted cities, and the first step is to manage ourselves with our cars.

There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a ""Car-Free"" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton."" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, ""Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed."" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.

We're in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can't even sleep at night due to all the thinking of ""how will I pay this?"", or ""how will I pay that?"" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common ""Facebook"" and other social media, we're able to connect more and more. It's sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of 'The End of Car Culture,' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller's say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35. ""Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Why drive and pay for gas when you can get on the web? You'll be glad you did.

Now, many will be able to disagree with me saying that, ""we need cars to drive long distances,"" or, ""I rather pay and have my own privacy then be with twenty people I don't know on a bus."" That's fine. I'm not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I'm saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk. ""What about the people who work in car companies?"" Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. We need to save ourselves from driving and polluting the earth, or else we won't have a great life to live. Blinding smog will cover the sky, and many won't be able to enjoy the rich outside there once was. All we will see are streets instead of parks. We need to stop ourselves from driving too much in order to live to the fullest.    ",6
9145057,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes the new technology facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows a computer to pick up on what you feel like and how you are feeling. I claim that the use of FACS in a class room enviroment could have used but mostly believe it is not a valuable resource in class.

One reason why It is not a vaulable resource is it only programed to read six basic human emotions which are Happieness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.

Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday. Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states ""using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face."" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.

Another person could say it is vaulable to help students and keep them entertained in a lesson and switch it up a bit. Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states ""For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers because Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles"" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem.

In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.",6
91d5de5,"A student is sitting in his seat alternating his facial expressions from a frown to a smile every other minute. The student is not necessarily happy, sad, or pocessing mixed emotions, but simply playing around and testing the new technolgy that has been placed in the classroom. New technology has been developed that can detect facial expressions. Dr. Hang predicts, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored."" What he doesn't stop to think about is wether this technology would be distracting, or bring other negative effects to the students. The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, put forth false information leading to personal problems, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn.

First, the use of technology that can calculate facial expressions would be a distraction to the students and the teacher in a classroom. Technology such as telephones, iPods, and smart watches have been banned in the classroom at most schools. This is beacuse they are a distraction to learning. Imagine a high technical computer that monitors all of 44 major muscles of your face to decect the percent ratio of the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness placed in a classroom of students from the ages five to eighteen. This would lead to a lot of distraction beacuse most students at this age would be curious of how it works, and if it works. Instead of listening to the lesson, the students would be messing around and trying out different facial expressions. This technology can also be distracting to the teacher beacuse they will have to be worrying about how their expressions are as well. They will be focusing on not looking negative, or being to harsh on the student since they are now being watched. This may ause them to not be as honest on feedback, and they may not be as focused on teaching.

Next, the technology in the classroom can put forth false information and casue personal problems. The technology can read, as previously mentioned the percent of how much anger, fear, and sadness you pocess. Many students at this age are going through a lot of changes and have many mixed emotions. For example, if the technology detects a particular student contains a large amount of sadness, fear, and anger for so many days, the student's parents should be notified because they could have emotional or mental issues. Though the technology seems very well designed, sometimes our facial expressions contradict our actual emotions. The technology can put forth false information of how we are feeling, and cause serious personal problems. Some people may believe the use of this technology in the classroom is beneficial becasue it monitors when students seem uniterested or bored, but a teacher can do such on their own, and all the many problems the technology gives is not worth it.

Finally, the technology can be a problem in the classroom beacuse it may cause students to feel uncomfortable. Many students struggle with their presentation skills at this age beacuse they may feel insecure or pressured, knowing that people are watching them. With this technolgy watching their every move and expression changes, it may cause them the same kind of pressure. This can lead them to not want to participate in class. In school the best way a teacher knows if you understand the material is if you ask questions, answer, and are involved. If this techology stops them from that, then it should not be in the classroom. In most schools, cameras are not allowed in the classroom, so that rule should be applied to this use of technology as well.

The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, malfunction and put forth false information, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn. In conclusion, the technology would bring a lot of problems to the students and teachers in the classroom. If there is only one good reason against many reasons not to have or do something then, it is usually not worth it. That rule applies here. Facial recogniotion technology should not be in a classroom beacuse it is uneccessary and brings neagtive effects to the students and teachers.   ",6
934ef15,"Humans have been curious about what is out beyond the sky for a long time. From ancient Greek and Roman astronomers who thought the Earth was the center of the universe, to Galielio who proved them wrong, humans have been wondering about what is truly out there amoung the heavens and the stars. In the ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author, despite the many harrowing ""challenges"" metioned, strongly and effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, calling to that innate human want to know.

One way he supports this endavor is through scientific logic. He cites how similar Venus is to earth saying, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". One of the best ways to support a point is through factual evidence. By making clear that Venusian exploration makes logical sense, the author strengthens his argument. The fact that Venus is Earth-like and at times very close distance wise to her, makes exploring Venus seem like the next logical step. This scientific backing gives the mission to know more about Venus crediblity and adds a sense of noblitiy, which makes it seem worthy. Without scientific backing it would seem like a far-fetched dream, unworthy of any time or effort.

The author also effectively supports the exploration of Venus through emotional means. He does this by dangling the possibility of life on Venus. He states,""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". It is basic human nature to want to not be alone. The want on community drives humans to great lengths to find others like them. Humans have and contiune to cross oceans, battle fields, and other challenging situations in order to not be by themselves. This pursuit for companionship extends to the exploration of Venus. Despite the temperature of Venus's surface being ""over 800 degrees Fahernheit"" and it having an ""atmospheric pressure ... 90 times greater than [Earth's]"" humans are still trying to think of ways to go there on the slim chance that there might be or might have been life there at one point. All in the hopes that humans might not be so alone in this grand universe. By tapping into the basic need and want to not be alone the author makes a strong case for the worthiness of Venusian exploration because many see the search for other life as noble cause and can relate with it.

Another way the author supports his point is by giving expamples of the progress already made and supplying hope. One of the ""challenges"" Venusian exploration faces is the weather on Venus. Venus has ""eurpting vlocanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strkies"". These condtions would frighten anyone. But to combat them, the author informs the reader about a possible solution proposed by NASA of a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". In doing so, the author makes the problems seem easier to solve while at the same time providing hope through a possible solution. By showing that the exploration of Venus might indeed be possible that author is able reenforce the worthiness of pursuing Venus. The question changes from ""Can it be done?"" to ""How should it be done?"" which makes it seem like a worthy adventure. The author also give the pursuit hope by diplaying a possible way for it to actually happan. This can get people excited and add to the fervor and want to find out what Venus is really like.

Through the use of scientific logic, emotional motivation, and inspiring hope, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is able to take an endavor that seems impossible and turn it into a worthy adventure that many can relate with and want to happen. The author taps into human curiousity and exploits it. In the same way the drive to explore the Moon enabled humans to reach new heights, so to does the author depict the study of Venus an epic mission, worthy of adverse challenges humans will face to accomplish it.

963705b,"The development of driverless cars is certainly an indicator that technology has come a long way since Henry Ford and the Model-T. However, it is disappointing that the technology at hand is being used to encourage sloth, laziness, and lackadaisical behavior.

Above all, the whole idea of driverless cars is a dangerous one. If drivers aren't alert and ready at the wheel in a precarious position, which there is bound to be, then it would result in an automotive accident that could cost someone his life, or a major lawsuit against the car company that didn't need to happen. The time spent developing these automated creations could be better spent creating other automated products.

Overall, humanity has to be productive. Productivity solves problems; Laziness solves nothing. In a time when there are many problems to be solved: global warming, cancer, religious extremism, civil rights, humans don't have time to waste. The projected ideas presented within ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" lead the reader to assume that the only way drivers wouldn't need to drive at all, is if every single car owner owned one of these smart cars. Then humans wouldn't need to drive, the systems used in the cars would probably show the best routes and make better choices, as well as prevent obstacles like traffic jams, but even if it worked big cities like New York and Chicago, where high traffic is incessant, this still wouldn't be practical. This leaves the human operator

the car wasting time, rather than doing something productive or worthwhile.

The whole idea of smart cars is dangerous. Some may deem it impractical, but seeing how far technology has progressed already, it isn't a large jump from driverless cars to driverless cars with wifi, and from there not much of a jump from car jackers to car hackers. The inevitable connection of these cars to form a more optimal system of driving as far as traffic is concerned poses a problem: system breaches. If an unknown entity were to hack one of the computer operated driverless cars and decide to tamper with sensors or other facilities, that could put a human in peril. If a driver isn't paying attention when the car signals to take over, or can't react fast enough, that also could result in danger for the operator.

There are much better uses for the systems and devices involved in driverless cars. The sensors could create amazing security systems. The GPS has a massive variety of uses already being employed today. The technology could create drones to assist in jobs humans can't do already. There's a vast amount of untapped potential that could be dangerously wasted on cars.

The driverless car creates opportunities. Opportunities to put others in danger, yet opportunities to give people a break. However, the driverless car must be taken with a grain of salt. Carefully examined, thoroughly protected, an eye catching piece of metal for the driver. Driverless cars have to come a long way before being ready for the public.      ",6
980a15b,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author used their thesis, counter-arguements, and rebutals to get across their point that Venus is a worthwhile investment to study. Some areas they exceeded and others they did not hit right on the ball.

The author throughout the essay did not convey a very well stated thesis. Typically, a writer of an arguementative essay would feature their thesis openly, so that the reader is able to see what side the author is pushing forward. However, this author did not do this. The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,"" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.

Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change. The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.

Furthermore, the author was able to affectively state rebutals and reinforce their own opinion with facts. From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray."" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,"" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.

The author of ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.",6
9a958aa,"Cars have always been used to get from point A to point B. That is how the people in society know what cars are for. However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world.

Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic somtimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic.

Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. Sivak even claims that ""A car is just a means of getting from A to B..."" Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic.

There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city; uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of.

Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late. Limiting car usage is a way that everyone can explore the world than being stuck in that four or tw door car. Limiting car usage has its downs but it also have its perks.    ",6
9d1a448,"Being a person of politics yourself, you of all people should know that many compromises have been made over the course of the establishment of the United States. However, some of the compromises, like the electoral college, were made because of factors in the past and are now not needed in today's modern democracy. While the electoral college once worked as a compromise in the past, it is an archaic system that unfairly represents the votes of citizens all across the nation. A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions.

In implementing the electoral college, most states' votes either go to one candidate or the other, leading to candidates to only campaign in swing states (Bradford Plumer 13). This may not seem like much of a problem, but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous. Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics.

With the Electoral College, there is also the risk that electors may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president. In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president.

In addition, a tie is likely in an electoral vote because of swing states, which has the potential to lead to a disaster. If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12). The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio.

Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision (Richard A. Posner 20). However, this is not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of other well-educated voters in other states who have opinions that will never be counted because of the electoral college. If the popular vote becomes the new method in choosing the president, voters all across the nation will pay more attention to elections because they feel that their vote can make a difference, and it will. This will in turn increase the number of voters actively paying attention to their country's decisions. Because of the Electoral College, ""about one-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election"" (Posner 23). Although this number is mentioned as a success in Posner's arguement, this means that there is one-half of American voices left unheard. Democracy only works if all citizens vote, but they will only take the time to vote if they know that they can make a difference.

Change needs to happen and it has to soon. If not, a poor president could be elected and then who knows what bad things could happen? With the popular vote, more people will be heard, and they will better take part in their country's government, leading to a better nation.       ?    ",6
9d5b06f,"The author of this article is only focused on one thing in this article. They describe all of these reasons on why traveling to Venus is unsafe yet completely ignores his own reasoning by replacing it with an unrealistic claim stating that astronomers want to explore it. Also, while they explain the density is the same and how Venus is ""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"","" they bypass the subject of how much will it cost, how it will affect the United States as a whole.

The author is failing to realise just how unsafe it is to actually go to Venus. They do go on to talk about the ""electronis made of silicon carbide,"" but it doesnt change the fact that we could not survive eight hundred degree wheather and neither could a space ship. the space carrier would melt when it came into the orbit of Venus. Also if the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide is it really safe for anyone to go there. On Earth, we have a lot of pollution and a vast amount of carbon in the air but it is nowhere near the percentage in the article. Then you have a atmospheric pressure of ninety times more than our own. The article describes how that would crush a submarine that has been made to search the lowest points of the ocean. The article states in paragraph three, ""Also noteable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking land on its surface.""

The author is not taking into account the people who would need to go on this mission as well. We are talking about a human that if they were to get past the spot where they are orbiting that they will be faced with all of these horific obstacles. The lightning strikes would try to kill anyone who tries to find land on the surfac, yet they are trying to send people to find out about their curiosities? Are we okay with that? All of these factors will end up in a loss of a human if we try to step foot on Venus and that is not worth the curiosity of a few.

Attempting to go to Venus would be extremely costly and would be a very poor choice on our part in the long run. We are talking about putting a group of people and equipment that cost billions to trillions of dollars on a space exploration that has a vast possibility of not coming home. It would cost us a fortune and no onewould gain from it. Hypothetically, let's say the the craft landed, what are they going to have to face to get a rock and gas sample? The volcanoes, lightning strikes, and powerful earthquakes would kill everything and everyone on board before the can let out a sigh of relief. Venus may have been an Earth-like planet but as of right now, no one would benefit from an exploration there.

Venus can remain a mystery. The author writing this article is not thinking about the good for everyone and/or the possibility of it even becoming a reality. The whole article is flawed because even though we are alike in size and occasionally distance, no one has survived the landing for a reason. The planet is too dangerous for us to even think about trying to explore, so we will wait to see if factors change but for now the author wrote this article poorly. We are not ready at this point in time and we may never be but the curiosity of a few are not worth the risks.",6
9ee0c20,"The anachronism that is the electoral college is a system that unfairly represents voters and can possibly lead to catastrophe. The much simpler solution would be election by popular vote where every voter in every state matters rather than the system of the electoral college that discounts many voters opinions. The arguments against popular vote are either illogical or inconsequencial and we as a nation should pay no heed.

The biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in the states. An example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by the system is expressed in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner where it is stated that in the 2012 election between Romney and Obama Florida gave all of its electoral votes towards Obama when he only won 61.7 percent of the vote. This method completely exludes the opinion of the minority, that 48.3 percent of people in Florida who didn't vote for Obama got their say taken away, their opinion no longer mattered to the election because all of the electors were given to Obama by a small majority. A second unfairness to the voters is the attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state. In the article written by Bradford Plumer named ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it is said that in the 2000 election that seventeen states got no attention from the candidates whatsoever. This system gives undeserved attention to a few swing states which will decide the election because of our outdated system of the electoral college. If popular vote was instituted the attention given to voters of all states would be equal as every vote from every state matters.

A problem with the electoral college that could possibly outshine the unfairness of it would be the potential for catastrophe that it brings. As is stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer the electors presented by the states according to popular vote are not even obliged to vote for the candidate they said they would. Even though this may be a rare occurace a single elector betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of Americans. Another possible disaster would be a tie vote in the electoral college. This situation, as explained in the same article, would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable even to the unfairness of the normal system. This horrible system consists of each state getting one vote for the president which when you consider that some states have many times the population of others means that millions upon millions of people could have the same say a a couple hundred thousands, an injustice unthinkable in our society and one that could be stopped by instituting a popular vote system.

The arguments against popular vote presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner are unrealistic, unsupported, or insignificant. The argument presented as ""Certainty of Outcome"" says that a dispute over popular vote would be much more common but provides no evidence to support the claim, invalidating it. The article's second argument states that candidates would have more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote were implemented but this entire argurment relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it doesn't matter because the same is true of population, no one region has an overwhleming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. The third arguement is the most illogical stating that the electoral college's tendency of causing only swing states to matter is actually a good thing because it increases the education of the populations of those states by the increased attention by the candidate, therefore the educated would decide the vote, making it more accurate. This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states. The articles fourth argument is possibly even more deluded than the third, stating that large states get more attention because of the electoral college which balances out the fact that states have hugely varying populations but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote. The electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere. The only argument presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner that has any merit is the fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated run-off elections. Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex run-off elections.

To support the eletoral college one must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence. This ""evidence"" can be easily refuted and outwieghed by strong evidence from the opposing side. To support the electoral college you are supporting unfairness and catastrophe and to any reasonable person that is not a very intelligent idea, making the need for popular vote irrefutable.    ",6
a00b247,"The Electoral College is a process that has been used in the United States Government for many years. It is the process that selects a candidate for Presidency based on electoral votes rather than the popular vote of the people. Many believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, but if we were to take it out of our governmental system, it would take away most of the effectivenss of our elections. The United States election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process of election, it is very effective for choosing a candidate, and when it comes down to it, the last process of the Electoral College (House of Representatives stepping in when there is a tie) is very unbiased and is also effective in choosing a candidate. If we were to abolish the Electoral College, the United States government would basically be starting over with their election process, which isn't necessarily a good idea once you are nearly 300 years into being an official country.

The United States' election process has worked very effectively with the Electoral College for a large amount of years. There is no reason why it should be abolished from the country. Throughout all of these elections, the best candidate was chosen for each presidency in the end because of this great process of election. Rather than choosing the majority of the people, which could have a biased opinion, it is left up to both the citizens and a vote in Congress. This forms a balance between the two opinions. It is a very evenly based system, as said in Source #3 ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our deprised methos of choosing the President"", the article states that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" This means that just by having one region of the United States really respect you and vote for you, this does not mean you are going to win the election. No region can get you the win. There simply are not enough electoral votes. Therefore, you must cover the most ground possible in the United States, because the more states you win over, the better your chances of becoming president are.

The Electoral College is a very efficient process of election. Instead of only the people voting and the decision of who becomes president left to the popular vote, the power of selection for presidency is evenly spread between Congress and the people. Some say that the electoral colleg is unfair, and that it is irrational. This is stated in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer. He states ""The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" This means Plumer believes that those who argue in favor of the electoral college do not take a look at the reality of things when talking about this subject. The electoral college is very fair when it comes to the election of a president, because we all want to choose the best candidate for the job, and the only way to do that is to have an effective system for choosing a candidate without having a biased opinion tossed into the mix to mess up the process. It's sort of like a job interview. You show what you have to offer to the boss (in this case it is the whole country), and if you are chosen for the job that means you were the most qualified and that you are the best choice for the job. Whichever candidate gets chosen for the job was obviously the best candidate at the time, and there is nothing that anyone can do to change that.

The one situation that most people worry about within the electoral college is when there is a tie in the electoral vote. In this situation, the decision of the election would be placed into the hands of the House of Representatives and the Senate chooses the Vice-Presidential candidate best suited for the job. It does not matter how many representatives there are for any one state, as stated in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. He states that ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, representing 35 million voters."" This means that no state has more power than another in this process, and every representative has the same amount of power when it comes down to chooosing a candidate best suited for being president. Additionally, it creates a sense of balance between all of the states and nobody has an unfair advantage when electing the next president.

As you can see, the electoral college is a very effective process used in the United States to choose a presidential candidate that should not be abolished from the country. With this system, the country has functioned very effectively for? a very long time, the system is very effective for choosing a candidate best suited for the presidential position, and it is very unbiased and fair when it comes down to the decision of the House of Representatives for the election. Abolishing this efficient process would just do a disservice to the country's election process, and I highly doubt that any whole-hearted citizen of the United States of America would want to do that to his or her own home country.

a1b24c3,"Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite.

To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign effors on the toss-up states."" As you know, toss-up state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group (Democratic or Republic). Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the canidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place.

Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he (or she) is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president.

Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the canidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.

In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.       ?    ",6
a1cd4ce,"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different deisgns, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common - they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutants given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollutions so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutant emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutants coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ""...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want wihtout rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway (Source 1). With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article ""Car-fre day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, (Rosenthal)"" When Heirdrum means ""this way"", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom; uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks; rush-hour will be cut traffic; and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed ""parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'"" (Source 4). In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.    ",6
a2082ba,"Childhood is often painted as a happy, idyllic time in our lives, but in reality, it's a precarious era of high emotions and crucial development. One of the best places to demonstrate the vast range of emotions a child or adolescent experiences is the classroom. Triumph, frustration, bitterness, and indifference are all commonplace feelings at school, and analyzing and understanding these are crucial to creating a better system of raising and educating children. That is why the Facial Action Coding System would be a fascinating, tremendously beneficial experiment that would revolutionize psychology.

The Facial Action Coding System is a new software, designed by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois, that constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and analyzes the movement of the muscles to indicate emotion: for instance, when you smile and raise your eyebrows, you might be 50% happy, 30% surprised, 12% sad, 5% afraid, and so on. There are six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise.

If we are capable of calculating human emotions through facial muscles, then we ought to use that power and knowledge to better ourselves. Let us attempt to understand our children, in order to judge and improve the education system.

For instance, a child might be surprised or angry when they do not understand a concept. Through the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher could more accurately guess which of her students grasp a concept and which do not. Additionally, reading emotions would aid educators in finding the best method of teaching for children of types, enabling more to become successful. This would lead a massive decrease in standardized testing and other measures of measuring how far along a pupil is in their studies. The Facial Action Coding System would not only enlighten teachers, but would save the government and schools precious time and money.

Furthermore, school life almost always overlaps into private life. Two students who are dating or are friends will continue their relationships outside of the classroom. Conversely, troubles and victories at home frequently bleed into their school work. If a child is having a rough home life or experiencing personal loss, they might not be as focused on the quality of their schoolwork, or, in extreme caes, act out. Teachers cannot be the sole support system for students, but they do have a responsibility to ensure a child's physical and emotional welfare, whether it means settling petty disputes or recommending therapy. Imagine the multiple lives that could be improved if the signs of unhappiness could be detected and addressed. On a darker note, the Facial Action Coding System would be most expedient in diagnosing depression, mental illness, and the tell-tale feelings that too many youths suffer from before thoughts or attempts of suicide.

Finally, utilizing such a powerful tool in the classroom would revolutionize child psychology. New branches of study could be devoted just to scrutinzing the way a face shows feeling. Experts could see how certain elements and events in life affect a child. A greater empathy would form, shortening the widening gap between generations, especially in this epoch filled with technology and new ideas, and allowing humanity to unite. A more focused, diverse view on society can be discovered through a child's eyes; we can improve our society, piece by piece. And all this can start with the Facial Action Coding System.

There are those who feel that subjecting children to these trials is an invasion of their privacy and imical to their natural development. It is true that a child should not be exposed to an excessive amount of software, and it is a valid complaint that invading their mind can be harmful. However, with responsible adults, the Facial Action Coding System can pick up on the children's discomfort and address their issues, from whatever cause, with more honesty and empathy. The Facial Action Coding System is a victory for psychology, and when used right and in moderation, it will benefit all parties.

The Facial Action Coding System will revise psychology. It detects the six basic emotions conveyed in the muscles of a human face, paving the way for an increase in enlightenment in our society's perception of childhood and coming-of-age. The Facial Action Coding System will assist teachers in determining their students' progress, help them grapple with their unfamiliar, often frightening emotions, and create a fresh look at child psychology. Despite the expense and the risk that scientifically calculating a child's feelings will hurt them, it is at least worth a try to see what a student can feel in a classroom and start making improvements in education and understanding humanity from there.",6
a39eecf,"Do you think that the Electoral College prosses is practical? Do you think that it is okay for someone else to vote for us? Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voteing and electing a president. Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process, it it outdated and not accurate, also the electorers have proven to be untrustworthy in the past.

Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors. Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidental election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes. Some people argue that the Electoral College is trustworthy, but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before?

Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it. Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any snese to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win! Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.

Don't you think that it is great to live in a free county where the citizens make the rules, and what is in the best interest of the people is what is taken into consideration more than what the government wants? Well, the Electoral College isn't what ""we the people"" want. We want to be able to choose who we elect, not another group of people. Some may argue that the electoral congress is good because if two canadates get the same amount of popular votes, the Electoral Congress acts as a tie breaker, but I'm sure that we can find a better way to break the tie than having untrustworthy people decide the fate of our homeland.

This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.    ",6
a66fe9b,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author argues the point that studying venus is a worthy pursuit, despite dangers that it can present. Throughout the article the author supports this idea with various forms of evidence. Ultimately, the author is ineffective at supporting their cclaim because they fail to provide sufficient factual evidence supporting it, jump to conclusions without providing sufficient logical reasoning, and provide significantly more evidence for the counter to their arguemnt than the arguement itself.

The author attempts to provide some factual basis for their claim that visiting Venus has worth, despite risks. They primarily included these in paragraph 4. The main ideas they used were that ""it (Venus) may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (4). This fact fails to support their argument, however, since the author does not provide any justification as to how it might make exploring Venus a more desireable option, especially considering the risks. It would make far more sense to simply explore a differnet planet that ws more hospitable and could actually be studied. The phrase ""once have been"" is also very telling. Certainly Venus is no longer at all Earth like save for its geology, as the planet has vastly different conditions to Earth in almost every other aspect. The author also states that Venus can ""sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"" (4). This fact also fails to support their conclusion that there is worth in exploring Venus, because the planet is only sometimes the closest option. At other times Mars is closer to Earth than Venus. If this is the case, then it would make far more sense to explore Mars as it is far less hostile to life than Venus is. The author again fails to provide sufficient logical evidence to validate the conclusion that Venus is worth the risk, especially because there is a safer alternative that is sometimes even closer than Venus.

In addition to failing to provide sufficient factual evidence in support of their argument, the author also jumps to conclusions before actually connecting any logical reasoning to them in order to justify said conclusions. The author concludes at the end of the fourth paragraph that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable."" (4) . However, they failed to provide any effective reasoning as to why this is the case. It would seem that the author began with this conclusion, but failed to actually justify it. It is certainly disputable that there is value in returning to Venus, so coming to such a strong conclusion on such flimsy evidence is simply ridiculous. It is simply another example of how the author faied to effetively support their claim.

Finally, the author provides significantly more evidence for the counter to their argument, than they do for the argument itself. Throughout the article the author gives details about how incredibly inhospitable Venus is to human life. For example, they state ""On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit"" (3), and ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (3). By providing this evidence the author is attempting to acknowledge the detractors to their argument and then provide a rebuttal to it. However, the author provides a much greater wealth of evidence for the idea that Venus is wholly inhospitable than they do for the idea that this difficulty is worth it. They provide only two brief facts on why exploration might be necessary, but have an example of how dangerous Venus is in nearly every paragraph. Ultimately this causes the claim that Venus exploration is worth the risk to lose validity because it creates a perception amongst the readers that the risks associated with the exploration of Venus far outweigh the benefits. It also contributes to an overall lack of focus in the article as the author constantly interjects facts about Venus' dangers.

Ultimately this author does a poor job at supporting the claim that exporing Vesus is a worthy pursuit despit the risks due to their lack of factual evidence, tendency to jump to conclusions, and the overwhelming surplus of evidence for the counter to the argument. These iniptitudes create a failure of an argument which is unable to stand up to even mild scrutiny.",6
a68d88a,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author presents the opinion that Venus is well-worth exploring, and well-worth the challenges that humans would have to face to pursue exploration. The author does a great job of explaining why Venus ought to be explored. They also do a pretty good job of explaining how we can explore Venus by bypassing the dangers and risks involved. However, the author does not do a good job on explaining why what we learn on Venus can help humanity. This shows that the author does overall, a nice job of supporting the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit, although they could have done better.

The author uses many points to explain why Venus should be explored. They state that Venus is the closest planet to our own, and that because of its close proximity to Earth, several spacecraft have been sent to the planet already (although all were quickly destroyed). The article also states that Venus was once Earth-like and could have possibly supported life-forms. ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and caters."" In addition to providing this piece on how Venus is still similar to Earth, it also states that Venus may have once also harbored oceans. All of these key points help the author show why they believe humanity and NASA should continue our pursuits on Venus.

The author also does an exempliary job of descrbing how humanity can continue its pursuits on Venus. Although the pressure is intense and the temperature more than any human could handle, there are still ways we can get close to Venus accoding to the author. They describe that using a blimp-like vehicle, astronauts and scientists studying the surface can float safely 30 miles above the surface, where the pressure and heat are much more tolerable. Another solution the author presents gets us much closer to the surface. Although humans wouldn't be able to physically be in vehicles such as this, but old-fashioned computers could be used to help remotely control a probe. These old computers use gears and levers to make calculations, not electricity. As the author puts it, ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions."" These other computers can withstand much more, and could help create a probe resistant enough to study the Venusian surface. The author does a great job at explaining and exploring the possibilities.

However, the author is a bit off the mark when it comes to explaining why what we find on Venus can help humanity out. Although it states what we can find on Venus, and how it is Earth-like and the planet closest to Earth, that doesn't explain why we need to waste resources exploring such inhospitable territory. Venus is in fact Earth's closest neighbor, and our nearest option for a planetary visit, but why would we need to visit it in the first place? Venus may have once been simliar to present-day Earth, but why does that matter to us? How would a study of Venus's surface prove instrumental to NASA and the world? The article states, ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."", but besides the fact the they state that it is Earth-like and closest to us in our solar system, they do not back this claim up at all. The author does a poor job of backing up the benefits to exploring Venus, and cannot defend why we should travel there to any benefit of humanity.

In conlcusion, the author does a decent job of defending his/her claim that Venus should be explored, although it could have been much stronger. They do a fantastic job of explaining why Venus is so unusual and how we can explore, but neglect to provide any benefits or reasons why exploring Venus is so important to the human race as a whole. However, even though the author did not include this in his/her article, it is still a decent article and is (mostly) thorough on why and how to explore the second planet in our solar system. The author, overall supports his/her idea in an almost completely sound way.",6
a6fe2a9,"Wouldn't it be nice if we could know the percentage of each emotion a person is feeling? With this new software called the Facial Action Coding System, that is now extremely possible. The use of this techonology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classrom is indeed valuable because it can help sutdents express empathy, help them improve in class, and overall help teachers understand emotions when they cannot fully reognize them.

There have been a plethora of conversations regarding empathy and how important it is, and the Facial Action Coding System causes empathy when we can clearly see what emotion a person is feeling. According to the article, ""empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"", so with this new techonology, we can improve the way we read other's emotions, and this can trigger a sense of emapthy within us to know exactly what emotion they are feeling. For students in a classroom this is beneficial because a teacher can understand the ranges of emotion their student is feeling, as well as help the students recognize the emotions of their fellow classmates. With this innovative technology, empathy could be something far easier to produce.

Along with producing empathy, the Facial Action Coding System can even aid students in ther performance in the classroom, because according to Dr. Huang, the technology can ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and this helps because ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" which can immensely help the student to become more engaged because the lesson becomes more interesting. Dr. Huang also notes that ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", and this is significant because a student may not voluntarily express that they are disinterested in a lesson, but the computer could recognize that anyways, and it is important for it to read the nonverbal communication the student reveals. Therefore, techonology can rapidly increase the performance of students by reading their emotions and engaging them into the lesson.

As well as improving the performance of students, this technology can improve the relationship between a teacher and student, becuase it benefits the teacher to know a student's emotion when they cannot fully recognize them. As an example, the article states, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" although, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."", which shows that us humans have trouble actually matching a facial expression to an emotion. Although, with the Facial Action Coding System, this ""computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"", which is significant because this code works to portray specific emotions. so we humans can better understand them. Therefore, in a classroom setting, this is important because with the technology, it allows teachers to be aware of what their student is feeling, creating a stronger student-teacher relationship.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would build a better relationship between students and teachers in a classroom setting, help students improve in the class, and produce empathy with both students and teachers. Nonverbal and emotional communication is incredibly important in human interaction, so this technology can help explain emotional responses, ""even when they are trying to hide their emotions"". A software that ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"" could potentially be greatly beneficial to students in a classroom, because of its complex ability to help humans express emotion better, which also helps the communication between computer and human. The Facial Action Coding System would be an incredible additon to a classroom, and would bring about major change and impact among students.         ",6
a8cc71f,"It sounds insane to even suggest whether or not to impliment a new system of computers taht can identify the emotions of students in a classroom. However, this is not because of the idea of the software but the absurtidy of truly modifying the education system around each individual student at once. It is beyond beneficial to students to impliment this system, it is revolutionary. It may be the first time in all of history that education is able to acomidate every student in the class room and ensure their success. The Facial Action Coding System should be implimented into classrooms to read teh emotional expressions of students in order to ensure their greatest success and the furthur success of the school.

These computers do so much more than read what is on a students face. They are able to determine emotions that maybe the student is not aware of or denies. This can determine what the student really loves and are interested in. This could eliminate unwanted or unessisary classes that prove no benefit to the students future based on their interests. To be able to change the curriculum around every student is to maintain a steady growth of every person into what they truly want and deserve to me. If science is a field of much interest, it would be easily determined by small changes in facial movements. This could allow for students to identify fields to pursue, making it easier and more enjoyable in the classroom. To continue down a path of true passion is more beneficial to everyone in the situation. D'Alto refers to a simular idea, saying that ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"" (D'Alto 6). Like advertisement, students would be able to follow a steady stream of interest, insuring the best and more satisifying education possible. By being able to elimnate certain subjects or topic that peak no interest, students would find themselves more involved and more passionate about the subject rather than simply turning away from all subjects due to the poor outcome or little interest in one. It is astounding that lack in interest in one subject can turn a student away from school. The Facial Action Coding System would not only help students with their interests, but keep them from turning their backs on school completely.

Although the students are mainly in charge of their education, teaching style is also a large portion of how a student learns or does not. If a student is bored, confused, or uninterested, it could be how they are being taught. How one person learns is not universal. However, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto 4). If students were able to be placed with teachers who would acomodate them the best based on learning styles in cohesion with teaching styles based on the science behind their facial expressions, grades would be higher and students will have a higher sucess rate. It is not fair to blame a teacher for a students inablity to learn in their environment, however it is the responsiblity of the school to place a student in their space to learn. By being able to determine how a student reacts to certain moments in a class or activities, schools would be able to change their curriculum and place students with teachers who would most benefit. This technology would produce better outcomes for schools, creating a new system of aulmni that are more likely to succeed in their field and therefore more thankful and loving towards their previous school. To blame the student or the teacher for the lack of communication is unfair since ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (D'Alto 6). To give students and teachers the opportunity to truly open up new possiblities of communication through technology is revolutionary because of the better relationships that would form if all involved are on the same page.

Many may argue that this technology takes away the part of humanity that is working with others who disagree. However, if humanity was able to perfect a system so that everyone was happier, would anyone truly disagree? Once out of school, if students were able to immediatly pursue a career in their interest and work with people who share this, they are again being placed in an environment best suited for them. This technology could not only eliminate unessisary classes or subjects but stress. If everyone was in pursuit of their passions, living their best lives, would anyone feel the need to aggresively brual or disaggree? This technology may not completely eradicate disaggrences, but it may eliminate unessisary arguments or issues. The Facial Action Coding System enables students to live and learn to their full potential while also benefitting teachers and schools. By enabling students to take charge of their education, success rates will reach unthinkable numbers. ",6
a9c7fb1,"Venus is an unknown planet, despite being so close to us. It is hostile, and no human could survive on its surface. But some think it is possible to reach the surface and study Venus up close. It has many dangers in the way of progress. It's clouds contain sulfuric acid, and it's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The pressure on the surface in 90 times greater than that of Earth, and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It boasts the hottest surface tempuature of any planet in the solar system, and has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent bursts of lightning that impeade probes and rovers exploring the surface. But some think it is still a possiblity to go to the hostile planet. The author of the article believes it is possible to reach and explore the surface despite the danger. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents by explaining that it may have once been earth-like a very long time ago, that it is the closest planet to Earth for exploration, and how scientists are now testing ways to get on the surface without any casualties.

The author gives support by explaining the fact the surface of Venus was once earth-like, and that it had many of the features that Earth has on it's current surface. It is amazing to think that such a unsuitable planet could have once been eath-like, but being near as it is to Earth, it is not entirely impossible. The author tells how many have made comparisons to Earth based on it's current surface, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because of it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system....Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The feature the author talks about are very Earth-like, so the possiblity of it once being like a ""utopain"" planet are not dim. He point out the valleys, mountains, and craters that can be seen around the surface. Maybe the craters were the cause of the hostility on the planet, and it's inhabitent were wiped off the planet by a imbargement of asteriods and possibly comets. And the crashs caused climate change, thus shifting the planet into it's demise for supporting life. But if it is so close, couldn't this be true, that Venus was once in the Goldilocks Zone, and while Earth formed, Venus was the planet of life. After all, it is our neighbor.

The author continues to support his ideas of exploration by pointing out the fact that Venus is, at most times, the closest planet to us, Mars being a bit more distant. It is often called our sister planet, as we have very much in common with Venus. The author explains how closly were related to Venus, and why we chose to explore it, ""Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desity and size.....Futhermore, recall the Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" It is about the same size, and relativly close, so it is one of the obvious choices. It is also noted that in space, time matters. If you don't get to the planet quick, your ship could lose oxygen, your could run out of food, or you might miss the planet when it goes through rotation, making harder to get home and less likely to reach the planet another time. Although it is hard to make the surface of Venus, it is our closest option and is more like us, thus making it more suitable. The question for scientists is how. This question may not be solved for a long time, but already, scientists are making advaces toward the next landing on Venus.

The author also supports his idea of Venus exploration by showing ways that people are making advaces toward a possible landing. New technologies and old technologies alike are being combined to make the landing last, and for futher exploration. The author shares some of the developments made by scientist recently, ""Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitide to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condition by staying up and out of thier way."" Another advance includes using new material the protect electronics and other computer equipment in the hostile environment, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of the Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" NASA has made significant advance in the pursuit of getting onto the most Earth-like hostile planet in the solar system. New discoveries continue to be made, and soon the expedition for Venus will be underway.

The author has supported his claim throughout the article that studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining it's likeness to Earth, it's closeness in proximity, and how scientists are advancing closer toward the goal of landing. Humans have done things like this before. The 1969 moon landings, for example, were thought to be impossible, but through human drive and motivation, we achieved this goal, and now we are faced with a new challenge, Venus. But with the same human drive and motivation that put man on the moon, people will explore our ""twin"" planet, and uncover it's greatest secrets. ",6
a9ea38e,"The ""face"" on Mars has become something of an controversy since an image of it was released back in 1976. The fact that people to this day believe it is still something created by ancient alien life bewilders NASA. Conspiracy theorists have concoted thousands of theories relating to NASA withholding information about extra-terrestrial life from the general public. None of which, have ever been proven, and/or ever had any solid evidence to back them up. Therefore, the face on mars is not the result of extra terrestrial life, but more of the result of hundreds of years of weathering and shaping.

As stated above, many conspiracy theorists believe that the ""face"" on Mars is the result of an utterly alien civilization. That is just not true. They accuse NASA of trying to hide it, yet, there is no evidence to support this. The discovery of an ancient alien civilization would greatly benefit NASA. The amount of funding and support they would recieve would be massive. Those within NASA's ranks that believe there is extra-terrestrial life out in space would have reached their lifelong goal of discovering it. There would be a huge incline of investors and programs willing to support and back-up NASA in all their endevours. Therefore, if NASA concluded that this ""face,"" was the creation of an ancient alien civilization, they would have no reason to put their finding out there into the public, without stating what they believed it truly is.

Another piece of evidence for the ""face"" just being a naturally formed feature, such as a butte or a mesa, is probably the most obvious fact. If NASA didn't want people to know about it, they would not have had it published for the general public's viewing. If NASA didn't want people to know that they had found evidence of an alien civilization, would they publish it and try to get people to believe that it was a natural formation? Of course not! It would have been a lot simpler to withhold the image and keep it secret rather than publish it. People make mistakes, but such a large government company such as NASA would have thought a little bit more before they published a picture they didn't want out there.

Finally, the last piece of evidence is another obvious one. Back in the 1970's, we did not have the sort of technology we have nowadays. The cameras were not as sharp and nowhere near the amount of pixels today's photography equipment has. The ""face"" was photographed twice more after the original image surfaced in 1976. The first picture was very blurry and was the main reason that people belived it was that of an alien civilization. In the original photograph, each pixel spanned about 43 meters, versus 2001's 1.56 meters. The second picture taken was a lot less blurry, and was taken in 1998. It showed a lot more and a allowed for almost no question that it wasn't what NASA said it was. People were not convinced, due to the fact that it was taken during a cloudy season on Mars, and was said to have obscured markings that might have led to it being identified as alien. The last picture was taken in 2001. There is no question with this picture. It clearly shows a natural landform with no strange markings and/or features.

The face on mars is not the result of extra terrestrial life, but more of the result of hundreds of years of weathering and shaping. After years of doubt, it is quite obvious that Mars' ""face"" is simply a natural formation. It is time for conspiracy theorists to put to rest their old, worn out ideas in favor of noble pursuits that can be backed up by solid evidence and scientific fact. It turns out, Mars's ""face,"" is nothing more than it's butte.",6
ab4d119,"Cars were invented by Harrison Ford to allow humans to have easier and safer access to transportation.

Cars and automotive vehicles were designed to enhance safety and allow passangers to efficiently arrive to their destination.

Cars were engineered to be driven, powered, and handled by humans, not to be self automated devices.

Humans as a whole should not have automated cars. Having a trasnportation vehicle that is soley reliant on detectors is not a safe way to travel from place to place. Whether the distance is near or far, accidents are always prone to happen, and those chances only increase with a human not in complete control behind the wheel. The article states that ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires,"" but can this really be achieved when the driver has the ability to become more distracted, stop paying attention, or even fall asleep when the car is being dirven for them? Having a self driven car allows many more opportunities to be distracted while on the road, and it is not garunteed that the driver will immediatley snap back into attention when human control is needed. If the car is unable to handle itself in dangerous or unknown situations, should people really be letting the car drive on a road where there are many unpredictable factors? The article says ""flashing lights"" and ""vibrating seats"" will notify the driver when danger is near, but this is simply not an efficient or probable solution if the driver were to be asleep or distracted, which would give anyone a slow reaction time. ""...safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" Haveing a self driven car would simply make the driver much too reliant on the vehicle they are in.

The world is becoming too dependent on technology, and if we allow ourselves to be driven by an object that was invented for us to drive, we are only furthering this conflict.

Becoming too dependent on technology has made us oblivious to the world around us, so just think how worse that could be if we allow cars that give us room to be side tracked while on the road with a countless number of individuals. If automated cars become a reality for everyone, what other things will we let do the simplest things we can do ourselves? The text states ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" This statement simply is not true in the context of self driven cars. We will still have cars, we will just fail to know how to use them ourselves.

Cars are a widely used object world wide, but not everyone can afford them. The cars we have today are expensive, so what will the cost of a new, self driven car will be? If the goal is to ""...release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time"" becomes reality, there will only be a select demographic of people who will be able to afford these cars. The more cars companies and manufacturers make and the less cars people are able to buy, the more in debt these companies will be in. Neither party will be benefiting from self driven cars.

Some individuals would argue that we as a society and race need to push ourselves forward and take advantage of the new technology being invented so we can take the next step into achieving greatness. This is a very broad notion that can only pertain to certain inventions and situations, the automated car not being one of them. Allowing all technology and inventions to take over our lives will only result in the lack of knowledge of how to take care of ourselves and the people that surround us.

We need to learn to become more independent on the things that are handed to us in order to keep the humanity we have. This is what seperates the living beings from the computers we come in contact with everyday. Others would even argue that the self driven car is safer to handle and will enhance the protection of others, but how can this be true if faulty technology is inevitable? Faulty technology will also result in confusing and frustrating lawsuits, as demonstrated in the article. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""

We simply cannot rely on computers to do all our work for us, it is impractical.

In conclusion, having self driven cars would only hinder our development as a society and lead us further into a future where independence of technology is greater than what anyone can handle, and will ultimatley lead to the decimation of the individuality of humans.",6
ab84f00,"Dear State Senator,

For years, the presidential election has been running with an Electoral College, one in which the public does not vote for their choice canidate directly, but instead for a slate of electors to have a final deciding vote. Although the system could have worked like a breeze when first originated-- a point to be reckoned with, since I do not see how the system ever correctly displayed the citizens of America-- the Electoral College method has proven itself to be un-deomcratic, unfair, and an unjustly irrational system.

Simply stated, the Electoral College does not allow an accurate representation of voter's beliefs, taking their votes and twisting, manipulating them into a deciding vote from electors. The popular vote can be seen as an input/output machine, the people's own votes going in the contraption, and once inside, the input is stretched and exagerated to output a ""neater"" electoral vote out of 538. While some argue that the Electoral College vote is usually rather close to the popular vote, it just isn't the same as when the Constution loosely states America as a? 'for the people, by the people' nation.

Several times throughout history, the Electoral college has swayed the presidential election in a completely different route than what the outcome of the popular vote would have been. The perfect example, constantly brought up in arguments against the Electoral college, is the 2000 election with main canidates of Republican George Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Through the popular vote, it is clearly seen that a majority of voters chose Al Gore to be their president. Through the process of the electoral college and manipulation of votes, though, the Presidental canidate ended with George Bush winning the election with a 271 electoral votes versus a 266 pointed toward Gore, thus creating an entirely different viewpoint of the people.

The idea of an Electoral College is also what has swung possible voters out of voting rooms, the voting method's 'winner takes all' outlook overriding. With the set up of the Electoral college, popular voters decievingly decide for a slate of electors instead of a President. For example, if a majority of Florida electors voted for Bush, the entirety of Florida's 29 votes are down for Bush, even though not all electors really did vote that way. Those citizens in states who do not fit with what large majority of voters believe are discouraged in voting for their own canidate knowning that, no matter what, it's almost certain their state will end up giving its votes to the canidate they oppose. This can lead voters to not voting at all, creating an even less accurate election while the country pushes citizens to vote, frowning down on them if they do not.

Besides major points, there are many smaller faults wiithin the Electoral college. In example, there is always the possibility of a slate voting for a canidate that differs from the one they have pratically promised to vote for. The fate of our country is put into the hands of the 538 members of the electoral college, opposed to the vastly greater full population of American citizens. Also, with the 538 Electoral College members being an even number, although rare, it is more likely for there to be a tie than if the popular vote was used in deciding the presidential canidate.

A pro Electoral college argument is that the citzens in swing states-- states that are likely to go either way in an election instead of an almost certian outcome-- are more likely to pay attention to ad campaigns knowing that their state is most likely what will decide the winner of the election. Advocates say that they are, on average, most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, and that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide our nations outcome. This outlook is littered with flaws, first starting off with the fact that swing states get more media coverage than the rest of the nation. These voters are valued more than others and are given more information to have an informed vote. Besides the fact that it is proposterous to value the vote of one citizen over another, this isn't fair to members of other states who recieve virtually no coverage due to canidates feeling like the state's vote has been secured since day one. The nation as a whole should recieve all the facts together with equal coverage, so that each and every voter can become a thoughtful one, and not only those located in swing states.

All in all, the decision to abolish the Electoral College is a backed up one, the facts and details there to support, meanwhile advocates for the practically ancient method don't have many solid counters to prove their point.

I hope you take this letter and it's claims into consideration.

Thank you for your time,

ac53aed,"Driverless cars, once thought to be only a far off and unattainable concept, are now a realistic possibilty in our near future. Already, manufacturers have developed working prototypes of driverless cars. With the possibility of them being an interactive part of our future, the topic as a whole begs discussion. Are they safe? How do they work? Will they ever be completely driverless? These are all valid questions, deserving of valid answers. While work is still being done on these cars, they are a safe, and should continue to be developed.

Driverless cars could bring an entirely new face to public transportation. The future of these cars hold not only the possibility of completely autonomous vehicles, but also ones that are more energy efficient. If the whole of a cities transportation system would go driverless, the system itself would be much more efficient. Unlike a cab driven by a human, driverless cabs do not have to stop for lunch breaks or other trivial and very human matters. The text states, ""Google cofounder Sergey Brin...envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This quote from a leader in the field of driverless cars shows that driverless cars offer a real possibilty for a much more efficient and flexible transportation system.

Real possibilities stand in the horizion for driverless automobiles. As of right now, cars are not completely driverless, as the text states, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" However, given the amount of progress the company has made since they began testing independently driving cars in 2009, it can be assumed that they will make more progress, and eventually develop a car that can drive completely independent. There is a real future in the field of driverless cars, and the only way to find out what it holds is to continue its development.

The development of driverless cars will also be beneficial to more than just the industry of driverless cars itself. The technology used in the cars can be applied to more than just the cars. The text states, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" All the forms of technology listed above are found in driverless cars, but they are also found in many other different areas of science and life itself. The technology that became available was not limited to a single use. No technology is. Science is an inclusive, interactive, and widespread concept. No single concept in science is used in only one design. For example, Velcro, developed for use on space suits, is now something used daily by ordinary citizens to keep our bags shut or our shoes tied. As new technology is introduced in the field of driverless cars, it will expand to horizions beyong just the cars themselves.

As much as the development of driverless cars could aid our society, some people still have concerns about them. The biggest concept that concerns citizens is their safety. Many people believe that a truly driverless car is dangerous, and could go rogue, malfunctioning and causing a wreck. However, even though people might not believe these cars are safe, they are. The text states, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel...Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road."" Cars may one day be 100% driverless, but right now they are not. A human is always in the front seat, ready to take control, and that means these cars are still as safe as a normal car.

Driverless cars, while they may only sound like a concept from a science fiction book, are a real possibility, and can affect our near future. Their development is crucial. They could bring about more flexible transportation systems and new technology, and the progress made so far offers substantial proof that this isn't a worthless subject. They are a very real and immenent possiblity in our future, and they should be taken advantage of. If development of these cars continues, then development of our future as a society continues.",6
af12c8a,"Dear Mr. Senator,

It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disasterous outcomes. You, and many polititions like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.

All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electors who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First of all, the general public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electors instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electors are not chosen by the people. Does this not contridict ""By the people, for the people?"" Where exactly do these people fit in?

Furthermore, the electors cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themself are trustworthy, electors are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electors can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an elector that won't come through, it takes all of the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.

Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electoral voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electoral votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen everyday, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of run-off elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have run-off elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a run-off election would be significantly lower as people would realize the power they had in deciding it.

As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all of the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electors to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all of the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.

b23c02c,"The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you.

Pictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren't as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform.

Furthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed ""ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976."" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the ""cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" Therefore, the camera used had to ""peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face.

Plus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the ""camera's absolute maximum solution."" Based on what I read, ""each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" There simply can't be anything you can miss using the camera's absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!""

Finally, NASA's explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren't actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn't made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it. Plus, there were no signs of aliens, or any life on Mars when they conducted this research. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",6

Some people believe that the face that has been photographed on Mars is evidence of alien life; however, it is just a landform because if NASA wanted to hide the existence of aliens they wouldn't have released this image in the first place, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face in any of the images, and if the face was in fact an alien artifact, NASA would use this to its advantage because they would receive more funding to find alien life since there would be proof that alien life actually exists. Obviously, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact but only a natural landform made on the surface of the Red Planet.

One of the most blatantly obvious reasons why this face could not be made by aliens is because NASA does not believe that it is. Now, every one is entitled to their own opinions, but because NASA is saying that this face is not an alien artifact you should think that same thing. There would be no reason for NASA to want to release an image that possibly supports that there could be alien life on Mars and then just say that it provides no evidence for life on Mars, if NASA actually believed there really was life on the Red Planet. Either, NASA would have not released the image at all in an effort to prevent people from thinking that aliens could be living on Mars, or they would release their image and say the truth. In this case NASA released the image and then said that it does not support alien life on Mars, so it is very clear that the landform is just a landform and not an alien artifact.

Also, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face. If this really was an alien artifact, there would be evidence left behind of the people that built this face, but there was not. And, the more recent pictures of the face were very high resolution, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters."" That may seem like a very large area for one pixel, but unless these aliens that live on Mars all live in one home that is less than twenty-five square meters, there is no one near this face that could've built it. Clearly, this landform could not have been made by anyone living on Mars because there simply is no one that is living close enough to this face to build it.

And last but not least, if this face on Mars was indeed an alien artifact, NASA would use this scenario to its advantage by blowing up the media with news of alien life in an attempt to gain more funding for the space program. There is absolutely no reason for NASA to try to keep the discovery of alien life a secret because, if anything, NASA would gain substantially from a discovery on that scale, so if the scientists at NASA think that this face is just a landform made on the surface of Mars, there is very little reason for someone to doubt them on this.

Now, some people may say, ""But wait! That face is clear evidence of alien life, and there is no way that a face like that could have naturally formed on Mars!"" If anyone is thinking that same thing, I can see why you may think that, but there is simply no scientific evidence to support your opinion. Yes, it is unlikely for a rock to form in the exact way to make it look like a human, but no, it is not impossible. Additionally, if that face was in fact a natural formation then there is no more evidence for it to support alien life than any other rock on Mars. Obviously, this landform was not made by aliens.

As anyone can see, the face on Mars is just a natural landform because NASA wouldn't release images propagating alien life if they didn't want to say that alien life has been discovered, there is no other evidence supporting aliens on Mars other than the face, and there would be no reason for NASA to try to cover this up because NASA would end up gaining in a situation where alien life was discovered.

Obviously this face is not an alien artifact; however, I believe that alien life does, in fact, exist, and that we may find it in the very near future, so look forward to what may come next.",6
b5dd327,"The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years. It allows for silly tricks to be played - you can win the presidency with a mere fourty percent of the country in support of you. You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count. The system even allows for massive corruption to go unpunished, which is one of the biggest offenses in our country.

The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country. According to source two, Al Gore ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Al Gore had a signifigant victory in popular vote for the nation, yet still was denied presidency due to the electoral college's vote assignment system. If we did away with the electoral college, each and every person would have an equal say, and would be equally important to the candidates.? Even source three agrees that the trust in our electors is occasionally betrayed, albiet rarely.

Currently, the candidates can completely ignore portions of our country. Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital.

The electoral college system also allows for an astonishing amount of corruption with no punishment. If a state manages to vote one hundred percent Democrat, rogue electors can still cast their vote for the Republican candidate - and this isn't against the rules. We're essentially putting the next four years of our country into the hands of 538 electors, and holding them to the lowest possible degree of accountability. Again, source three clearly states ""and that trust is rarely betrayed."" While it's rare, it's still more than possible, and can be quite disasterous.

Some may argue that the electoral college system puts into place a system of certainty and safety, for both the candidates and the people. This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, ""the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised."" While this source claims that ignoring biased parts of the population, this is quite far from the truth. People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote.

Our country prides itself on being ""the land of the free, and the home of the brave,"" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.    ",6
b6994cb,"The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers within the Constitution, was meant to serve as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of citizens. What the founding fathers failed to see was the many outstanding flaws within the Electoral College. For many imperative reasons that cannot be avoided, elections must be changed to the method of popular vote, and the Electoral College must not be a part of the United States' elections any longer.

The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occuring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people. Source 2 informs readers that state legislators are are technically responsible for picking electors. These electors could very easily decide to vote upon who they would like to see in office, rather than who the citizens want. The impact of this would be trecharous when the wrong person is elected as president. Source two quotes, ""Back in 1960, segregationsists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. How is that for a compromise between Congress and U.S voters? Furthermore, another way in which keeping the Electoral College would be disastorous would be seen in the case of a state sending two states of electors. Bradford Plumer reminded those in favor of the Electoral College that this has happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, enormous downfall was avoided because Vice President Richard Nixon, presider over the Senate, validated his opponent's electors and did so ""without establishing a precedent."" However, America may not be so lucky the next time this may take place. Senators in each and every state must open their eyes and really see what is happening in their country. The U.S must change its elections to the popular vote system, where all of these impacts will be avoided. The Electoral College does nothing for its citizens, and states may send two states of electors to it, and for these reasons, America will face a very unhappy situation if we keep this system.

Popular vote is a much better system than the Electoral College because unlike the Electoral College, it is actually fair for its citizens. America, which has suffered greatly to acheieve equality and liberty is held back by one thing-- the Electoral College. This is suffered by the United States' citizens because of the College's winner-take-all system. Through this, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Source 2 refers back to the 2000 campaign, saying, ""...seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" How can a president be properly elected with this system in place? Source 3 attempts to discredit this claim, aguing, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign..."" What they fail to realize is that those citizens may not even know who they are voting for! It is lucid that there is simply no valid argument for outting the fate of the presidency into the hands of a couple swing voters in a state. In addition, as far as being unfair goes, there are also unpredicatable scenerios that may occur in elections. These scenerios are far from fair to anybody. For instance, there is always the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that were to happen, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives where voting would be handed over to state delegations. Plumer quotes, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to...unfair."" This would not happen if the U.S adopts the popular vote method, where the most popular candidate will win and reflect the citizens who placed him or her into office. The Electoral College is nothing other than unfair to the citizens who rely on it to elect their president.

For many reasons, election methods must be changed to popular vote, and the Electoral College must be disgarded. It will only lead to a profound disaster, and it is also extremely biased and unfair. The United States must take action, one state at a time, to reverse the negative path it is on. This is the only way the U.S can finally reach its long term goal-- complete prosperity.       ?

b6d2705,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author has shown how Venus is a planet that is worthy of our exploration through a few different points in this essay. However the author also uses many different examples of why Venus is/has been too dangerous for humans to venture on. But the essay does lean towards how necessary it is for humans to be curious about this journey more so than not, and they author does this using a few examples. Overall the author uses a large amount of their evidence from NASA mainly to describe certain ways they are trying to solve the problems and how they have started to already.

The author does introduce the con aspect of their essay first by explaining why humans have not been able to journey onto Venus' surface yet. They start by saying, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades""(paragraph 2). This is not the most reassuring few phrases when the goal is to get humans on the surface of Venus. But by adding this in the author is placing an understanding of what the dangers are. The dangers are plainly that if a spacecraft cannot survive the surface of our neighbor planet. . .then how can a human possibly do it.

So by adding in that scare factor the author then switches the tone to describes the certain parts of Venus that scientists need to get close to. Because in order to study it they need to be close enough to see it clearly. The author tells us all of the different features that are similar to Earth and because of all of these similarities scientists can learn and discover so much about our planet from Venus. The author names all of these similarities which are: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system . . . has a surface of rocky sedimet and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters""(paragraph 4). When the author says this they are leading the reader in to want to know more about what Venus is like. This is because when they say that Venus is ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" they are making the reader wonder what Venus must be like. Also making the readers curious as to what humans can learn from this planet as well. Which is a major benifit in a risk management scale.

Next, the author also introduced a possible solution to the problem that is Venus' surface. They found out that NASA is doing their own research on how to land safely on Venus and to be able to withstand a longer duration of time there as well. The author said, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. . . Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus woud avoid the unfriendly groung conditions by staying up and out of their way""(paragraph 5). This is a major point because if NASA is already finding different ways that they can have ships on Venus, they are a step closer to having a ship survive on the surface as well. This is also very important because as they are discovering different materials that are lasting in Venus-like condition, and they are learning more about what could work for humans. Because if they were to create the ship that would float above the fray; then they would be able to have scientist there to observe and learn about Venus. The only problem with this is that the scientists wouldn't be able to collect samples from the surface yet.

Furthermore, the author explained a few different points throughout the entire essay. Some of them consisting of cons to the situation, like how a spacecraft is unable to last longer than a few hours on the planet. But other parts of the essay were how important it is for people to go and search Earth's sister planet because of the very similar landscape that the two share. The author also added in some of the different solutions NASA is trying to decypher and perfect. For example the plan to have a ship floating over the fray so that scientists are close enough to make observations but they are just far away enough that they are unable to take samples. Over all, the author portrayed Venus as a highly worthy planet to explore and that there are many different factors as to why it is so important. ",6
b8103da,"Dear Florida State Senator,

Every 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the? Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!

Because of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.

According to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.

Florida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the ""swing"" states to win ""the people's"" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the ""swing"" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!

In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery. Many people will thank you!    ",6
ba61675,"Every four years, the United States is turned into a political battleground by the campaign for presidency.? The electoral College, the voting method used since the nation began, Is being highly questioned on its efficiency now vs the efficiency 250 years ago. However, the system has survived because it works.? Despite its flaws, the Electoral College does a good job of simplifying the presidential election and eliminating disputes or a potential crisis.? It produces a clear winner, it makes sure that the president is popular in all areas of the country, and it puts the weight of the campaign on the swing states.

In most presidentai races, the president wins only by a small margin.? rarely is there a landslide? victory or a complete vote for a president.? This small majority can lead to many disputes over the credibility of counting the votes in the individual states.? This is why the Electoral College helps the voting process.? The Electoral College helps the voting process because it produces a more clear winner.? For example, in line 21 it claims that ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote sompared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"".? This shows that while the popluar vote can be extremely tight, the winner gaining sometimes less than 1 percent of the popluar votes, the Electoral College helps the system by giving the winner a landslide advantage and therefore clearing up any claims over the credibility of the popular votes which the loser can produce.? Also, the Electoral College helps prevent the situation of no president winning the majority of the votes.? the introduction of third parties can sometimes mean that no party gains more than half of the votes.? However, the Electoral College helps deal with that situation.? In 1968 and 1992, Nixon and Clinton both had less than the majority, but won because they had the Electoral College in their favor.? This is why the Electoral College still works today.

There are some areas of the nation that are very highly populated.? The southern and western regions of the nation are becoming more and more populated, and the northern regions are diminishing in size.? By popular vote, a president who wins the southern regions alone would have a good chance of winning the nation.? However, that system does not work under the electoral college vote. The Electoral College is a good system for voting on the president because it requires a president to be popular across the nation.? Under the Electoral College, a president can not suffice by winning the votes in a couple of states.? They must get points from states across the nation and then will it add up to a victory.? This is good because a president with only a regional majority will mainly focus on the region which he is based on.? The other regions will be disregarded, and not paid as much attention to.? The Electoral College prevents this outcome.? This is another reason why the Electoral College is a good method of picking the presidency.

Most states will have a tendency to almost always vote for a patricular party.? The real difference in Electoral votes lies mostly in the states who will vote either way, or 'Swing States"".? The Electoral College is a good thing because it puts the emphasis on the states who will vote either way, ensuring the credibility of the candidate.? These swing states know that they are the ones who decide the election.? Therefore, it is the voters in these states who pay more attention to the campaign, who research the candidates more, and who listen to what the candidates have to say.? This is a bonus for the Electoral College because it means that the candidate who will be elected is the candidate who will do best for the country, not necessarily the most popular.? Because of this, the Electoral College should remain the system of voting on the presidency.

There are arguments that the Electoral College should be abolished.? That the system of sending electors to congress to vote for them does not work because they can't guarantee that the electors will vote for who they are supposed to do.? However, the chances of that happening today and the elector getting away with it are very slim.? Today,? The people and the government know exactly how much votes each state gave to each candidate, and they know exactly how much electoral votes a candidate should get.? So even if you manage to add a vote to your candidate,? It's very likely that someone will do the math and figure out that something's not right with the votes.

Like every system, the Electoral College has its flaws.? However, the system is the best we can put in place to elect a new president.? The system still is used after 250 years because it easily simplifies the disputes that can easily occur over the tight popular vote margins.? So the next time you vote for the president, You'll know that you are voting in the most efficient democratic system to date.    ",6
bd2306a,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but fails to provide enough support to make that statement believable. The author stresses in parts of the article that Venus is valuable and needs to be explored but then counters that with lenghty paragraphs explaining the hazards that come with this. The ratio that Venus is valuable but exploration is dangerous is not one to one. This makes it harder to believe that Venus is actually worthy of exploration. The author mentions that Venus is valuable, but then counters by explaining the dangers that come with this exploration, and finally includes the steps that are being taken to get there which never sheds light on the importance of exploring Venus.

First and foremost, the author does indeed suggest that Venus is important and that it is worth exploring. However, the times that the reader can actually see this written in the article is very few, specifically three times. The first time this happens is in paragraph four and it says,""Recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration"". The next time it is mentioned is a little bit after that and it says, ""The value of returning to Venus is indisputable"".

The last time is at the end of the article. The quote says,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself"". All three quotes are supporting the idea that Venus is valuable to exploration, but they are never given any evidnece to back them up making it hard to believe what they adovcate.

Now, besides the fact that there is little to no support for the previous quotes the author goes on to explain the numerous dangers that come with simply trying to explore Venus. The author spends the majority of paragraph three explaing the hazards that Venus presents. The text says,"" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". Later on in paragraph three the text says,""Such and environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to divnig to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqueft many metals"". These two quotes raise red flags in many readers minds, causing them to wonder why scientists are even considering exploring such a deadly planet. The author also failed to inlcude a counter to the dangerous conditions on the planet and didn't explain why it is still valuable.

Finally, the author tries to make the dangerous and possibly deadly pros list seem okay and feasible. The author goes along to explain the steps NASA and othe scientists are taking to possibly make a trip to Venus. According to the text, ""One particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"". This quote creates a sense of hope for the exploration argument but does nothing to explain to the reader the value in exploring Venus. The text also states,""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, simplified electronics made of silicon have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". This quote, yet again, explains how there are possible and theoretical steps and options that can be taken to make exploring Venus safe,

but in the end sheds no light on any benefits, advances, or values that come from being able to explore Venus. The majority of paragraphs five, six, and seven explain more steps and ideas that could be used but, in the end, provide no support for the argument that exploring Venus is worthwhile despite the dangers it presents.

Many people can conclude that space exploration is a positive, beneficial process. However, after reading this article it seems that exploring Venus is not the best idea. The author tires to support the idea that exploring Venus is worthwhile but only mentions it a few times. Then within the middle and end of the article the author stacks multiple counters to his or her argument.The author goes on to explain the hazardous conditons of Venus and steps to get to the planet but never explains the importance of even trying to explore Venus. In the end, the author did not successfully support their argument.",6
bd3ec7d,"While there have been presidents that have run without earning the popular vote, it does not mean that the Electoral College is inefficient, bad, or unnecessary.? The Electoral College, chosen by our founding fathers, is a process in which people elect for electors.? Then the electors vote for the president.? Each state gets a certain number of electors, or electoral votes, depending on their population.? This way, no single group of people can sway the voting largely.? Instead, only the state would be effected.? Without a doubt, the Electoral College has been working well for centuries, and I see no good reason to change it.

For starters, it is much easier than a popular vote to decide.? Yes, the chance for a tie is there, but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays.? Counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty, even right here in the Sun Shine State.? Imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one!? Even though a tie is more likely this way, the odds of a tie are so rare, what does it matter?

Another truly great thing is the fact that any president must have appeal to all states, or at least most.? Having the favor in the south and concentrating it there will not give you more votes.? In fact, it is more likely you will not be president if you yeild strongly to any one region.? Doing so may lose you many votes in other areas that may be difficult to recapture.? If a president was for say, leaning towards big old California and Florida, but not going very much for the other states, then yes, he may win many, many votes from California and Florida and possibly win the election, if it was a popular vote.? But this is not the case.? In an electoral votes, winning all votes in a few states is hardly useful.? That, of course, plays majorly into elections, which is a reason why some of your favorite presidential candidates didn't win.

Another great thing I am to mention is loss of plurality.? What if my buddy and I each got only 40% of the votes.? The other guy in Tex. got the other 20%.? Who would win?? In the Electoral College, the Tex. dude may win a few votes in each state, but rarely will he win any.? With the Electoral College, other minor candidates are less likely to screw the whole thing up.

It is true there have been faults.? Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all antagonized the Electoral College.? One reason is that electorals do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning.? If my vote gets some Bob McShnuffle into the electoral voting system, but he votes for someone other than my choice, then there is going to be major pandemonium.? Is it fair that your vote and so many others gets flipped just because Bob McShnuffle was unhappy with that president?? Perhaps, but this does not happen often.? Usually, it does not cause too much of a balance tipping.? But the true problem is the word of the people.? We have so many speakers for us, but they don't always say the right things that we want.? Fortunately, these incidents do not happen all the time.? To fret over such things only offers you more problems and less solutions.? By having an elector, a representative, someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him.? Instead, this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict.

On that happy note, I must mention the electoral college is not perfect.? Nothing is.? But it is easier than popular voting, counts all states and regions, and naturally avoids run-offs.? Of course, its still got its flaws.? But you have to admit that those founding fathers did pretty good.? Arguably, it has been the best way for the presidential election, and it still is...    ",6
be3dfcc,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a famous landmark on, you guessed it, Mars! Many people believe that it is just a natural landform, but others believe it was created by aliens. Why do people believe that it's created by aliens? Well, they believe that the Face is bona fide proof that there is life on Mars, and NASA is hiding something from us. In my personal opinion, I believe that it's just a natural landform that just happens to look like a face. I think that because I think the odds of aliens creating a face on Mars out of no where is very illogical. So in this essay, I'm going to prove to you that the ""Face of Mars"" is actually a landform instead of an actual alien artifact!

One of the main reasons I believe that it is just a natural landform is because according to the article, mesas are something that is common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. And since the face was located in Cydonia, it wouldn't be out of place for there to be a mesa there. So in the beginning, scientists told everyone what it really was, another Martian mesa, but it was shaped like a face. But many people noted something that was in the article in paragraph 2, where it said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. My explanation for this is maybe the mesa was formed a certain way that made it have these out of place shadows, because not every mesa is alike and some may have different shapes than another. Also according to the article, it notes that very few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact, which means there are someone skeptics among scientists, and sure, scientists may be smarter than the average person, but that does not mean they are always correct.

Now we move along to even more important evidence, the pictures. The pictures are important because if you look at the picture of the ""Face on Mars"" taken in 1976, you could see that it really isn't that clear, but you can make out a face in it. But if you look at the better pictures in 1998 and 2001, you can see that they're a whole lot clearer than the ones in 1976. Right now I'm focusing on the one taken in 1998, which according to the article, it was posted on a JPL website where it was revealed as a natural landform. But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority.

3 years later, on April 8, 2001, another picture of the Face was taken. This one was much clearer than the one in 1998 due to there being no clouds. According to the article, the pxiel size in the image was 1.56 meters, and as rule of thumb, if there were any alien markings or another of that sort, they would've been able to be seen in the picture because of the pixels. So the ""Face on Mars"" was got rid of its skeptics and now many scientists say it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. According to the article, Garvin says it remind him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, because it is about the same height of the ""Face on Mars"".

So in conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa plain and simple, and the main reasons are because of the pictures, and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around Cydonia, which is where the Face is located. Another reason why I don't think that you should believe that it is an alien artifact is, there is so much evidence to why it isn't whenever people just pointed out obvious things in the picture, like clouds of haze covered ""markings"" in the 1998 picture but there weren't ever markings on the mesa as revealed in the next picture taken in 2001. So to end this essay, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa, not an alien artifact as many skeptics believe.               ",6
bf09ba6,"What if teachers were able to monitor their student's emotions during class? In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", by Nick D'Alto, D'Alto talks about a technology that was developed that can detect how someone or something feels based off of facial expressions. How the technology works is that there are certains muscle in a person's face that codes for different feelings and if they move a certain way, then the person is conveying a certain feeling, which the computer can detect. This technology is interesting, but it shouldn't be used in school environment. Sure, there are some positives but overall, the negatives outweigh the postivies. This technology is expensive and insufficient, not necessary, and invades privacy, which can be a distraction. The technology used to identify feelings and expressions should not be allowed in a clasroom.

This technology is too expensive to put in classrooms. It requires a good amount of money in order to install in into a classroom. Many classrooms do not have it right now too so it can be a huge blow to a country's capital or economy. Since many developing countries do not have the money to put this technology into classroom, they will lag behind in education even more, since they don't get the benefits that this technology may provide. Not to mention, investing a great amount of money into the technology is nt worth it because even in developed cuntries, there are bigger problems to worry about and more important issues that the government needs to fund for. Also, this technology is insufficient because as stated in the article, ""PC can't handle the complex algorithms used t decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This shows that there are some computers that cannot handle the complex algorithm, so even if a school wanted to invest in this techology, they need good quality computers, whch is putting a bigger hole in their budget. Although this technology would be nice to have, it is a problem financially and insufficient.

Along with it being a financial burden, this technology is not really useful in classrooms. In schools today, many teachers plan out their lesson before the class starts. With this technology, if a student were bored, the teacher would have to either change the whole class plan or let the student be bored. Also, there will be occasions where one student is interested in material while another is bored. This info really isn't useful because the teacher cannot satisfy both students at once. And then there is the issue with techology these days. In the article, a line states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Since many students are attached to their phones or devices, knowing their emotion really is not useful. They are either bored or not interested in the lesson. All in all, this technology really does not provide much in the learning environment today.

Finally, this techonology can actually be a distraction and invade privacy. By being able to detect a student's emotion in class, the student may feel insecure. This can cause them to become paranoid and focus on their thoughts and assumption rather than the lesson the teacher is teaching. In the society today, cyber bulling is fairy common. If a student is already insecure, then knowing the teacher is monitoring how they feel in a classroom could cause the student to break down. And then there are the group of kids that want to be class clowns. Students can purposely activate a muscle in the face that codes for a different feeling than they are actually feeling. This could make students focus more on messing with the technology rather than paying attention in class. Another conflict that came to mind is if a student is feeling down because of something that happened in their life. Teachers may call on that student. With this device in a classroom, students can find this technology as more of a distraction than a use for the teacher.

In conclusion, this technology has more of a negative impact rather than a positive impact in the classroom. It can serve as a distraction to the class atmosphere, a financial burden to a country's economy, and does not make a huge impact overall in the classroom. Although this technology is very interesting and provide some positives, it should be used just for kicks and giggles and not incorporated into a classroom.",6
bfaf295,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tries to explain the several complications of sending a mission to Venus. They provide tons of factual evidence about the geography and climate of Venus. They give many good points, but ultimately fail at their task to convince readers that Venus exploration is worth it. Along with a failed point, this author tends to go off on side-tangents that have minimal importance to the story.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet. Venus is likely the most similar planet to Earth, with its rocky surface, hills, and mountains, but it has much more limiting factors to deter us from traveling there. It has terrible weather in comparison to Earth, with acidic carbon dioxide filling 97% of the atmosphere and with heats of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The authors gives plenty of information about this planet, most of it relevant to the topic at hand, and therefore succeeds in teaching you about Venus.

Even after succeeding in information given, the author fails to promote the idea that travel to Venus is worth all the cons. They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned.

The final point to take into consideration when reading this article is the authors' side-tangents. Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the ""Evening Star"", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the ""Evening Star"" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.

Overall, this article about Venus is less than ""stellar"". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up. All in all, the author does not support their idea the best.",6
c149d08,"The ever developing field of technology continues to change and shape our lives every day. As we migrate towards a world that is more technalized than ever, it is inevitable that technology eventually begin to be able to do human functions such as recognizing emotions. The Facial Action Coding system is a prime example of this with many valuable assets. The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable in a classroom as it can be used for online lessons, can allow teachers to see how individual students feel about certain topics, and can allow students to connect with online learning.

Online lessons are a amazing example of how valuable this technology can be in classrooms. As Dr. Huang predicted in the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" classroom computers with this technology could moniter a student's emotions and then modify the lesson accordingly. If a student already knew the information and was bored, the computer could detect this and the lesson could move on to something more challenging. If the student was confused, the lesson could go into greater depth in its explanation. The possibilities are endless. This is extremely valuable when it comes to online lessons. Online education is becoming increasingly popular but the problem is, it is hard to modify the lessons based on the student's individual needs as a teacher can when teaching in person and seeing the student's reactions firsthand. This technology would allow teachers to have online lessons in their classroom with the lessons still being fitted to the student's individual needs.

Sometimes it is hard for teachers to gauge how students feel about certain topics. Students are not always honest with how they feel, especially when they need help. This new technology provides the solution to this problem. The computer could monitor the student's emotions during certain lessons on certain topics and then compile this information for the teacher to analyze. Using this data, the teacher could see how each individual kid is feeling about topics and know who is confused and needs more help and who is ready to move on to something harder. The teacher could also see the percentage of the student's emotions as shown in the article. This is priceless for teachers as it allows them to gain undertsanding of their student's emotions towards what they are learning and allows the teacher to act accordingly.

When learning from a physical teacher, students can emotionally connect with them which enables them to feel more comfortable with the material and what they are learning. Computers do not have this. However, with this new facial action recognition technology students would be able to connect with the computer more because they know the computer is recognizing their emotions and acting accordingly. The students would feel understood. Students being able to connect more with online learning is a major development and could ultimately revolutionalize online education.

Critics of this technology may argue that it cannot replace human interaction and the human connection between student and teacher. While this is true, this technology is not aiming to replace this interaction but instead, enrich it. If the teacher is more aware of the student's emotions, the connection can deepen and the teacher can help the student in ways the teacher did not know the student needed help previously. This technology allows education to grow and become more personalized. It is not trying to replace the human interaction and connection of teaching but enable it to grow.

Modifying online lessons based on the student's emotions, teachers having knowledge of how their students feel about topics, and students being able to connect with online learning are all perfect examples of how valuable this technology in classrooms truly is. Some people may argue that technology can not replace human interaction, but that is not what this technology is for. It is for enhancing the connection between students and teachers. This new technology has many assets and many ways that it can be valuably used in a classroom.",6
c1ffeb5,"The Face

Some people belevie that the landform is a face, but they need to face the facts. The face is that hte ""face"" is just shadows on a landform. NASA has discovered that the ""face"" is like a butte or mesa on earth which are landforms common around the American West. In 1998 NASA captured photos that revelad that it was just a natural landform, and in 2001 using the camera's highest resoluton on a clear day the photo comfires this. Some people might say that NASA is trying to hide the fact that there is alien life on Mars, but they need to look at the fact that NASA would love that and would benefit form finding alien life. All together NASA has the evidence to suppor the fact the the ""face"" is just a landform.

First off, NASA has discovered that the ""face"" is just a butte or mesa commonly found in the American West. In the article it states, ""'It reminds me moost of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'says Garvin"". This shows that NASA's cheif scientist for it's Mars Exploration Program knows it is just like a butte or mesa. This means that a person who sees things like this on a daily basis knows that it is just shadows making a land form look like something else. If a cheif scientist knows that it is just a landform than that means that we should have no problem understanding what it is.

Secondly, in 1998 NASA captured photos that it was just a natural landform. NASA was able to look at the pictures of the same area and tell that the ""face"" wasn't created by aleins, but was just a ""freak of nature"". In the text it states ""Michael Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera tteam snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photo"". This shows that the picture in 1998 was much mre clear and that shadows caused the ""face"" on Mars. The original camera used by the origianl Viking team cannot compare to the one used in 1998. The original photo that showed the face happened because of a horrible camera and shadows. With this evidence about the camera it confirms that the ""face"" is just a landform.

Lastly, people complained that the photo in 1998 didn't show all of the landform because of the clouds in the wasy, so in 2001 on a clear summer day Malin's team captured a new picture. The text reads, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution"". This shows that the team took the best photo on the best conditions possible and once again proved that the ""face"" is a landform. Malin who is a professional took two pictures that prove that the ""face"" is not a face at all yet, a natural landform that looked like a face from the shadows. With the evidence from the maximum resolution camera it is easy to see that the ""face"" is a land form.

On the other hand, some people say that NASA is hiding the fact that there is alien life on Mar's. These people have absolutly no evidence to support that claim. NASA is struggeling with budget cuts would have mush more funding for finding alien life so that atomaticaly throws out the possibilty of NASA iding alian life. The consporacy theorists also have no evidence to support their claim. NASA has taken multiple photos that show that the ""face"" is just a landform like a butte or mesa (which are most common in the American West). With all of the information pointing the other way consiparcy theorists have nothing to go on to support their wild claim.

All in all, the evidence only supports that the ""face"" is just a natural landform. The ""face"" resembels a butte or a mesa, and NASA has taken multiple high quality pictures that prove that it is just a landform. Although somepeople might disagree, the ""face"" is just a simple landform and will look the same way for years to come.",6
c433787,"Many technological improvements in the field of education are being made every day. There are constantly new and exciting ways to educate and teach students each and every year. However, behind all of that technology there must still be a competent teacher/instructor there in order to fully teach the material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not valuable because it lets teachers not engage as much with students, is not necessary for a successful learning environment, and would be too complicated and powerful for most computers to be realistically implemented throughout the country.

While technology can definitely assist in giving students a worthwhile academic experience, there still must be a competent and engaged teacher past it in order for students to truly learn. With more and more advancements being made, it gives teachers and instructors less and less responsibility and obligation to teach properly and effectively. While some may argue that a human instructor is not necessary for students to learn, it is still more beneficial for a fellow human being to convey the lessons being taught alongside the technology than just the technology teaching. In the article, the doctor who helped develop the technology states ""''...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote shows that this technology could essentially take over a lot of aspects of a teacher's job, giving the teacher less of an obligation to teach their students. Human instructors are important for people to learn material effectively, so they must be given a certain amount of responsibility in order for there to be a good learning environment.

While this technology could theoretically be beneficial for students, it is not an essential aspect needed for a successful learning environment. The article talks about how this technology can assess people's emotions similarly to how people do in person everyday. In the article, the doctor who helped develop the software says ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" This could be a helpful tool in certain scenarios, but as the article mentions, humans do this process naturally throughout the day and while we cannot assess as accurately as a computer could, we can still sense the general emotion of someone. This makes the face analyzing technology a possibly beneficial tool, but an unnecessary and unrealistic tool as well.

Even if this technology were an absolutely essential part of every classroom, at this point in time it is not realistic to expect it to be implemented effectively. This software is relatively new and is powerful, so an expensive and powerful computer must be used in order to utilize it well. In the article, the author states that ""Your home PC can?t handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa?s smile."" This quote implies that most PC's currently available to people would not be capable of using the software. Even if most schools could acquire the powerful computers needed to run this software, it would take a serious and detrimental chunk of funding away from other more important school aspects such as lunches or libraries. Even though the techonology can be helpful in certain instances, it is not realistic to expect schools to be able to implement it anytime soon.

The Facial Action Coding System is a promising new technology, and as such has it's fair share of issues. While seemingly impressive and futuristic at first glace, once one begins to take into account other factors the system starts to become more of an interesting novelty than a breaking new education tool to be used in classrooms across the globe. New developments often bring improvement with them, but before being implemented must be tweaked and carefully considered in order to be successful. In around a decade, this facial reading software could be a typical sight in many classrooms. But as it stands now, it has too many flaws and issues in order to be taken seriously.",6
c7430fd,"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some constroversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and? almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, ""in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the canidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extreamly unelikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College"" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a run-off election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their canidate because they are chosen by the canidates party or the canidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won.    ",6
c7a806f,"It's FACTS That We Don't Need FACS

Being in school brings out a mix of emotions in every student. Wether the student is stressed, happy, or sad depends on many different variables. A student can feel these emotions because of a situation at home, a problem with a friend, and obviously because of the lessons or schoolwork going on in class. Can a machine truly and effectively montior these emotions? Is a machine like this really needed in the current education system? It's not, The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a calssroom is not valuable.

First of all, human emotions are complex. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" gave us several examples of muscles in the human face that were used when expressing emotion. A couple examples of these are the ""frontalis pars lateralis,"" and the ""orbicularis oris."" Although these muscles and the parts of the face they move are an important part of dictating emotion, that's not all there is to understanding emotion. Body language is a massive part of emotion. The FACS may register a happy smile, but it won't see slouching shoulders. The text even states that, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion.)"" This means the FACS reads a blank expression as showing no emotion. What if someone with a person with a blank expression is conveying emotion through body language? Being a student and teenager, body language is a huge part of communication. With the FACS not being able to read body language, that's already a giant hole in its value.

Next, how useful would this technology be outside of an elementary school setting? The answer is absolutely not useful. In elementary school the teacher caters to each students' needs. They're able to do so because you have the same 20 to 30 kids every minute of every day for 180 schools days. But, in middle school and high school students have seven to eight different teachers throughout the day. Middle and high school teachers don't have the one on one time to cater to their students. As cold as it sounds, middle and high school teachers simply might not even care about their students feelings. At least not to the degree an elementary teacher would. Teachers in the upper levels have a strict set of standards that they need to teach. Students must then master those standards to pass the class. There isn't enough time for an upper level teacher to care about their students' emotions.

Finally, students are kids. Kids experience a plethora of emotions throughout the day. Even though, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are unviersal,"" what would one use the information gathered from FACS for? Dr. Huang believes that, ""it [FACS] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that the text states that FACS is just as effective as a human teacher completely renders itself useless. If Dr. Haung, the software engineer of FACS, believes that this machine performs on an equal level to a human, there is absolutely no need for the FACS. As previously mentioned, upper level teachers do not have the time to modify their lesson plans due to their students emotions. That fact alone removes the need for the FACS.

In conclusion, the use of FACS is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS does not have a place in the current education sytem. With evidence from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is clear that the FACS is only on the same level of reading emotions as, ""an effective teacher."" This renders the FACS not only as useless to students in a classroom, but also as a likely massively more expensive alternative to human teachers.    ",6
c8f48f9,"Automobiles have become a necessity to keep our world functioning. Unfortunately, there are irreparable damages that cars can cause to the environment, which is one of the arguments used by people supporting the idea of driverless cars. The process of creating these cars undoubtedly takes a lot of money, along with other issues. While the development of driverless cars prompts a progressive future for the automobile industry, there are too many issues against this form of driving, like safety regulations, how the current laws on driving will be affected, and how to deal with accidents and lawsuits, so driverless cars are not an ideal thing to continue developing.

The number one concern involves how safe these cars can be. Although companies like Google take safety measures and thoroughly test the cars, there still is an element of uncertainty. With normal cars, it's up to the driver to pay attention to the road. The driverless cars claim to have sensors that detect any unusual activity, like Google's Toyota Prius, which has a LIDAR, a sensor that will use laser beams to update a 3-D model of the car's surroundings (Paragraph 4). This is one of the many sensors that each have a unique job and are needed to keep the car functioning. One problem that arises with these sensors is the reliability of them. Technology fails all the time, like a phone or television, and there are people that are hired to fix those issues. With driverless cars however, if someone were to crash or be stuck on the road for an unknown reason (because this technololgy is relatively new), will there be someone that can immediately fix the car? Because of the little reliabilty in this technology, there are a variety of safety concerns that would repel buyers.

The process of getting these cars on the market for normal people will take a long time. There will certainly be a number of government officials that will oppose this new technology because of how much it will change the laws involving driving. The laws currently reflect situations involving human beings behind the steering wheel, which is deemed the most safe form of driving. There are still states that oppose even testing the cars. Even if the rest of the states follow the few that already allow testing of driverless cars, there are too many changes that will be made regarding the law system. Since the biggest priority is safety, the laws will need to emphasize a back up plan from manufacturors if anything was to happen to the car-not involving the person behind the wheel.

With this new technology, lawsuits will start to become a blur. Deciding who was more responsible for the accident will get increasingly difficult. It will involve having to figure out every time the driver took control of the wheel, and whether the other cars were driverless or not (which will also have to be evaluated). This will make every lawsuit become more complicated than necessary. If there was a situation where the manufacturor was at fault, the credibilty of them and the reliabilty of the car will decrease. There will need to be new regulations set for any situation possible, in addition to the many laws involving normal cars. Driverless cars will become increasingly time consuming to deal with instead of making lives easier.

There are too many issues against this form of driving, like safety regulations, how the current laws on driving will be affected, and how to deal with accidents and lawsuits, despite the fact that driverless cars claim to make driving safer and easier. This branch of the industry will cost a lot of money, and would be a waste if it were not successful. People today like being in control of their environment, and driverless cars will take that away.

ca58ee7,"9When looking at the world from a birds eye view, it is possible to see the beauty in the world; Even so, in certain developed and developing areas, the people are choking. The choking is not just supported by the violated environment, but along with that, society is an advocate for the pain of the people. An intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars. With the progressing world also comes regress, and according to an article wrriten by the New york times in 2013, it was stated that in countries such as the United states of America, ""Americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each yeat goes by."" This eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the U.S.A. Although the car industry may suffer from this, it is essential to note that, the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public. In fact, in the long run, the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole. This can be seen in three major ways, with first, public benefits , second, cheaper and time-saving methods , and finally the unmatched environmental benefits .

As people continue to choke from the pain, it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem, and limiting car usage is the definately one of the best ways to reduce the harms. The public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress , more space , and increased saftey . Starting off with stress, Heidrun Walter, a mother of two children stated that she was ""always tense"" when she had a car. she now lives in the German city of Vauban. Here most people have given up on cars, including Mrs. Walter. As a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation. With Mrs. Walter, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". These people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit. Moving toward space, an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in 2009, states in this new approach, we will have make it so there is less space for parking. With less space for cars, there is more space for people. Not only that but with the increased limit, there is a decrease in traffic. Traffic can be extremely long, and in this case it will help to increase public space. Although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety, in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat. Therefore, with their limit, there can be an increase in safety for the people. Moving back to Mrs. Walter, she as a mother of two did want the best for her children, and above all comes their saftey. Meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces.

Although people do want to benefit as individuals, it really comes down to the cost at the end point. But limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person. In fact, by limiting cars, alternate transportation is promoted. Countries such as Colombia, have move on to bicycles. The major of Bogota(a city in colombia) said that due to the limitation of cars for a day ""It has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"". This is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars. This means that transport would be so much more affordable. Now with the increase in bicycle travel, there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic. And although cars are much faster than bicycles, the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel, bicycle travel will be more efficient. This ultimately means that by limiting car usage, transportation will be cheaper, and it will be just as efficient, if not more. It can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel, but David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes. By limiting car usage, these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation. Indeed in the end? Vauban is correct in calling this ""smart planning"".

Now comes out the benefits everyone knows about: the environmental benefits. Smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world. In countries such as China, it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog, daily. But what may not be as common to people is that a country such as France has also started to see a similiar problem. Pollution in France is actually rivaled by Beijing(one of the most polluted countries in the world) as reported by the Chicago tribune on 2014. Cars have been the major cause of this, considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by cars. In fact an article named ""The end of car culture"" states that cars are one of the highest sources for carbon emissions. By limiting car usage, cities such as Bogota and Paris, faced amazing results. Overall by limiting car usage the environment benefits exponentially.

In the end the solution to the people choking in the world, is simple: limiting car usage. The advantages of this limitation can be seen with benefits to socitey. This can be seen with public benefits, cheaper and time saving methods and of course the environmental benefits. ? ? ? ? ? ? ?       ?       ? ?       ?    ",6
d2d423b,"In the classroom, a teacher may not be able to fully understand and realize the feelings and emotions of the students in their classroom. The teacher will not be able to meet with every single one of their students to make sure that they are doing okay and understand everything in class. However, with the Facial Action Coding System, things may change. The Facial Action Coding System is extremely valuable in the classroom because it may allow teachers to focus more on students that are confused, sad, angry or fearful. Furthermore, the system can be used to make sure everyone understands what the teacher is teaching at their own pace.

First, the Facial Action Coding System can help students learn at their own pace. The computer would be able to recognize whether a students thought the subject was too easy or too hard by their countenance. For example, in the text, Dr. Huang predicts,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" So, since a teacher usually teaches everything at the same time, these computers may be better because some students excel where other students don't. These computers would help the excelling students have a constant challenge while students that take time could slowly grasp and understand a particular subject or idea. Evidently, the Facial Action Coding System is something that can be valuable to a class and help everyone learn comfortably.

Another benefit from the Facial Action Coding System is that the technology could inform teachers on how their students are feeling. In the article, Dr. Paul Eckman associated six basic emotion- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness- to specific facial muscle movements. Through this technology, the teachers may be able to help support students that are feeling sad, angry, or fearful. The teachers would be able to become a counselor figure for those students that are feeling unpleasant emotions and help them overcome the difficulties that they are having. Through the removal of unpleasant emotions in the classroom, all the students can be happy and work together to bring knowledge and success into their lives.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System could help create a classroom atmosphere in which all students feel welcome and happy. To certain students, the way they like to learn or study may be different than how other students may. To solve this, a teacher could try out different types of classroom settings, lesson plans, activities, etc. Then, the technology could help the teacher determine what the students liked the most by their facial analysis. This could help create a classroom where all the students are having fun and engaging with the subject rather than being bored and reluctant to study.

In addition, this type of technology could help provide a safe learning environment for students. Through this technology, teachers could see students that are feeling malicious and angry, which would allow them to prevent future problems or consequences by helping them through couseling. If teachers were not able to understand or see the feelings of a very angry and upset student, consequences could occur such as fighting and misconduct. So, the Facial Action Coding System can also provide safety to students and teachers alike.

Some critics of the Facial Action Coding System may say that a student has their right to their own personal feelings. However, although it may cost a minute amount ot privacy, the Facial Action Coding System may save many lives. For example, by knowing a student is sad, teachers would be able to prevent suicides by giving emotional support and making sure everything is safe. In addition, teachers could help prevent child abuse or bullying by knowing if a student is constantly showing fear. Preventing the abuse or bullying of students could prevent a gruesome future and allow them to pursue their dreams and be themselves without fear.

The benefits of the Facial Action Coding System substantially outweigh the negative aspects. The Facial Action Coding System may be the key to successful education where all the students grow in knowledge while having fun and actively enjoying the subject. The teacher may also be more aware of what is going on in the classroom through this technology, allowing them to meet individual needs of their students. Because of the benefits that would come from such a technology, the Facial Action Coding is a valuable tool for the students and the teacher in a classroom.",6
d62b9c4,"It's safe to say that almost everyone on Earth has tried to hide their emotions on at least one occasion. Humans do this for a reason, and that reason is that they do not want others to know about them. Trying to pry those emotions out can lead to anger, frustration, and confusion. So a person being surrounded by emotion-detecting computers might not be the greatest thing. Now add the factor of millions of emotional teens being faced with them in a place where they are already strained. One of the worst things one can do is assume about something they can't truly understand. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom.

The first obvious elephant in the room is that everyone shows emotions in a different way. While Dr. Huang points out that human facial expressions are universal, he does not deny that ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This stands to be an issue when it comes to reading a persons face. If everyone has different facial expressions, how effective can a computer be at tracking them? It isn't a valuable resource to use if there are so many unreliable factors that play into the performance.

In this day and age computers have taken over in classrooms. Students ranging from elementary to college use them on a daily basis. By adding FACS, Dr. Huang predicts that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Paragraph 6). This sounds great, but it just isn't reliable. When using a computer in a classroom, students aren't exposed to just the computer. Their environment can effect the way they feel as well. A student could be having multiple conversations that spark emotions like anger, boredom, or confusion. If FACS picks up on those emotions that don't accurately reflect how the student feels about the lesson content, then it isn't providing valuable information. Without it providing useful information, the technology isn't valuable in a classroom.

One aspect of FACS that is useful is that it would create a system that appeal to individual users. A nice example used in the article is ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (Paragraph 6). This is extremely helpful and great for getting rid of those pesky ads. However, it has nothing to do with students in a classroom. Students aren't exposed to ads, and this would provide no benefit for them. The value of this is nonexistent in a place where it can't be used, such as a classroom.

While FACS may be an extremely impressive software, it just doesn't serve as a benefit for students. There are no truly reliable elements that will improve classrooms in a meaningful way. It may be useful to some, but when it comes to students it is not a valuable piece of technology to have.      ",6
d8361b9,"Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.

This new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions."" Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.

Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world's emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its' accuracy.

The Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication."" This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored."" As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.

As the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher's knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.

All in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.

d9738d3,"Driverless cars aren't really driverless and may even cause more problems on the road. One negative aspect is that eventually the ability to drive a car would wither away and die. For example, if you took a one year old baby and cooked for and fed him until he was eighteen, would he be able to cook? Even if he watched you cook, he can never cook how you cook because he was never taught the skill. It wasn't needed. So just like that, manual driving can be eradicated for generations to come. Eventually, would anyone know how to drive?

Driverless cars are a thing of the future, but are they really better for us? Not necessarily. Although, there are just as many good things as there are bad. If a driver is exhausted and wanted to relax after a long day at work, then the driverless car can drive him home and into his bed. But maybe driving the car was the only thing keeping him awake and alert. There are solutions to this problem, the article states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" But does this eradicate any threats or problems of driving driveless cars? But they aren't all bad. There are just as many positive characteristics then there are negative. But I believe that many issues will arise in the future.

Of course, they aren't completely driverless, but I strongly believe that driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. Well that's a lie, because they're actually worth a lot. This introduces my next topic, inflation, of sorts. Even if all of the good overcomes the bad, the money value would increase exponentially. You think cars are expensive now? With all of the new technology and saftey features the car is now 5 times more than its original price. Not to mention if something needs to be replaced, how long will it take to make the part? What are the repercussions of ""fixed"" car parts? How expensive is one car part going to cost? Maybe even more than the car itself.

Furthermore, if the driverless car does get into a wreck, who is at fault? The article also states that new laws will be enabled due to liability coverage. If the technology failed, or just malfunctioned, would it be the manufactor's fault, or the drivers? Moreover, this opens up multiple scam oppertunities. Car companies have been known to scam people for their wealth, this is cutting edge ""scam material."" Car companies can rig a car to make it seem like it's perfect, and make it malfunction later to blame the driver. This can cause the problems between multiple car companies and their consumers.

These are some of the more minor issues. Mechanical products are not perfect, they have equally as many flaws as humans do. This can result in the loss of lives, the initial poverty increase, and even the simple result of losing the ability to manually drive a car. These are minor problems to car companies, but to one individual, it can cause many, many problems. But there are good things about these smart cars as well.

Retrogress back to paragraph two when I stated, ""There are just as many postive characteristics as there are negative."" I reiterate, there are more bad things than good, but there are some very good aspects. Such as, being able to drive safely and do other stuff that wasn't appropriate while driving such as watching your kid, doing some paperwork, and even able to send a text message without endangering others around them. These are only some aspects, what about the ability to make traffic run exponentially fast and safe. That is a positive aspect for all. But previous problems have arisen and they are the ""hallmark"" for inefficient driverless cars.

Nonetheless, I believe that driverless cars are not as reliable as many might think. I also believe that the thought of leisure while driving somewhere is a spontaneous oppertunity. These aspects may change life as we know it. Add them all up and it's clear to see that these ""smart cars"" aren't so smart after all.",6
dd64f5b,"Google has always been there for us when we need a fantastic search engine or when we need to figure out what special holiday it is, but little did we know about there lastest invention! Google has been seeking for a better technological future since 2009 with there latest peice; the smart vehicle. Although, this great thought has come to life for the world to visualize, I don't really believe that this invention is as great as the world may see it to be.

For a place which is already called ""Lazy America"", why would this nation want to progress the other lands thoughts on that belief? The fact that there are cars being made for the laziest of people who don't have the moments of time or ability to sit and drive to go from one place to another is upsetting. These cars are being made for the people who rather text, eat, (etc.) and drive than pay attention to the road. Google had mentioned that their cars must have ""the human driver..remain alert and be ready to take over.."", but Google is trying to get around that problem so the car is totally self-operated. Not only Google, but many other vehicle companies. For example, in paragraph ten, it states that the ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drives themselves by 2020."" What does this prove? Does this show that America's self worth is our inventions? No, I believe that this shows how unbelievably lazy this world has become.

Secondly, Although this autopilot car may caught the heart and the eyes of everyone who has heard about this invention, I'm positive that these cars could not be afforable to the people who want them most. Because of the amount of time and money that it took to research how to make these cars, it would cost lots of money to replenish those funds and there is only one way of doing that for those vehicle companies and for Google; selling their cars for higher prices. For this reasoning, many of the lower classes and comfortably living middle classes would not be able to pay for the cars. In paragraph one, it talks about how ""the car he{Sergey Brin} foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis.."" and cars, which is good for our planet and good for the ozone, but if the only people who have these cars are the rich, which is low in numbers of people as a whole, what difference would it make if the many people who cannot afford these smart cars are still giving off these gas fumes and pollution into the air? Many people think about how this will affect the human race and how great of an invention this is. Yes, this invention may have its perks, but it wouldn't make a difference for those who cannot afford the first downpayment of these cars.

Lastly, the amount of regulations and laws that have to be overturn would take many, many years for these cars to even be legal to drive in many parts of the world! ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" I firmly believe in this. They say this because when a human driver is always operating the vehicle, they are forced to pay attention for the sake of their lives or others.

The narrator of this article that ""..special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"" at all times, but even if the human driver is holding on and behind the wheel that does not mean that they are paying attention 100% percent to the road ahead of them, which happens to be a scary thought. Many people fall asleep behind the wheel when the car is fully operated by them alone, so this would not stop many people from falling asleep.. Especially if they don't have to do anything to drive! If those many alert sensors do not alert the sleeping person, that may be trouble. Getting that passed through traffic laws would be difficult; Even for Google!

Although Google has been there for us for about a good decade and a half, helping us with our internet needs, that doesn't mean that they need to continue to move forward with something like this. The smart car, may be a pretty new thing to gaze and gauke at, but is it safe for our everyday use? Would it be safe for our newly founded driving teenagers, who already text and drive? Teaching people that it's okay to be lazy and not pay attention to the road is not something I would want to support and I believe that many people should stand behind this thought. I say ""No"" to this contraption.",6
dd852e1,"Do you believe that NASA is with holding information about an alien species? Many people in fact do. However, their arguments are severely flawed. There are thousands and thousands of naturally made landforms on planet Earth, and we can only logically assume there are even more naturally made landforms in space. The landform that is debatebly the most 'likely to be made by aliens' is the Face from Mars. Contrary to what the alien theorists may say, the Face is only another naturally made landform since in high quality pictures it appears quite normal, there are no strange markings or anything around it, and its appearance is only an illusion.

NASA and its team has tried many and many times to get clear pictures of the Face. Nowadays, its getting some of the best pictures that's ever been taken. Jim Garven quotes, ?We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.? ""..on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,"" furthermore says the article. The pictures showcase the Face as normal and just like any other naturally made landform.

Another thing about the Face that will throw off any conspiracy theorist's opinions is that there are no 'alien monuments' or 'carvings' or 'writings' or anything else around the landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all,"" quotes the article. That wouldn't satisfy the theorists so they thought of something else. Which is, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Try as NASA might, they didn't find anything that could possibly be apart of anything alien. They took more pictures of the Face, especially on days where it would be clear, yet they found nothing of the sort.

Now, one of the biggest things about the Face is that its own 'face' is an illusion constructed by shadows. NASA even described it as so. When they released one of their first pictures of the landform, ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" Illusions are everywhere, and this particular illusion of a face happens to be quite popular. Their picture of the Face attracted much attention from the public because of the allure of a face on Mars. As their pictures became more high quality, it became clear how the formation looked and how those shadows made it look the way it did.

Others may still say now, that the pictures that NASA takes might very well be positioned badly or incorrectly in a way that does not reveal anything crucial to alien life. NASA listened to them though, ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" Mission controllers made their way to look at the landform once again. A direct quote from Garvin about the situation is, ""It?s not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work."" He and everyone else went out of their way to take the perfect picture on a ""cloudless summer day"". ?We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin?s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera?s absolute maximum resolution,"" says Garvin once again. ?As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,? he added. ?So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!? NASA did their best and better at looking at and around the Face in order to see if they missed anything as important as signs of alien life. They returned with no proof of anything at all as the theorist's would've liked.

To summarize, the Face is a naturally made landform ontop of planet Mars. First of all, in high definition and quality photographs the landform looks normal and not that strange. Secondly, contrary to what alien believers and theorists may have liked to believe there are no 'markings' or etc. around it whatsoever. Lastly, the eyes and nose and mouth that happen to 'appear' on the landform are only an illusion made by shadows, as stated by NASA itself. Earth has just as many natural landforms and even more possibly than Mars. With a trick of the light or seeing it as a particular angle, we could even interpret our own landforms as something that was made by our own hands even if it clearly wasn't. The Face is a clear example of overthinking and reaching for an answer that was already there, it is a naturally made landform. ",6
dda8663,"New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track. The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas.

Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.",6
dde0bcf,"The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" presents a well written case on why mankind should continue to look for ways to explore Venus. The author presents the article starting off with information on Venus and how its challenges inhibit scientists from exploring it. They present the challenges in an orderly way, how scientists may be able to counter these challenges, and why it is so important to get there.

Getting to Venus will be the easiest part of the task that scientists are faced with. In paragraph 2 the author states ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"". Getting to Venus is the easiest part of the task, but staying there will be exponentially harder. In paragraph 3 the author presents the many challenges scientists have to face to be able to stay on Venus following the logos method. These include but are not limited to ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide..."", ""clouds of of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."", and ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". That is just the atmosphere, not including Venesian geology and weather.

Despite all these challenges, the author believes scientists should keep trying to study Venus and shows some ways that scientists have already begun to take on the problems presented. In paragraph 5, the author cites NASA's possible solution on how to counter the surface of Venus. NASA wants ""scientists to float above the fray"" in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". Despite getting here the author presents another problem in paragraph 6 with scientists getting ""only limited insight on ground conditions"" because of the dense atmosphere. To counter that problem, the author cites another NASA approach to studying Venus which includes ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide"" and ""looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"".

With all these challenges and oftentimes complicated solutions the author supports the idea that through all the trials and errors the payoff would be significant to satisfaction and provoking of human curiosity. In paragraph 4 the author claims ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". Being able to reach Venus's surface would enable explorers to look for life no matter how big or small and see if it was possible to survive the harsh environment. Even more so, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" which would help scientists to determine how Venus was formed. The author appeals to pathos in paragraph 8 stating ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". The author wants the reader to understand that mankind as a whole should not shy away from the challenges presented no matter how dire the situation and should face it head on, if for no reason other than the question ""Can we do it?"".

The author presents their information in an orderly fashion, makes their article easy and clean to read, and appeals to pathos and logos. They go in-depth on the situation, the solution, and why mankind should worry about it in the first place. All in all it is a quick and concise article that was well done and well supported.

dff0c49,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" stated that meeting the challenge of exploring Venus is valuable because it will provide more knowledge of the planet, but also because humans will be curious about many dangerous things in the future. The author stated many dangers and doubts of exploring the planet, but then described solutions that may or may not work. It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes.

The author of the article described Venus as Earth's ""twin."" That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's ""twin,"" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth. The author needed to be clearer on which way he wanted people to view that statement.

The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times. Then, he would proceed to follow the statement with tested and untested solutions. It was hard to tell which way he sided. According to the author, ""Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes..."" He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information.

The author went off topic throughout the article. The different information created slight confusion as to what the message he was trying to convey. The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, ""The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers..."" It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.

The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.      ",6
e026f3c,"Space is always going to be a mystery to us. We will never be able to explore all of our universe. However, we can stil hold hope that maybe there are other life forms out in space. So when ""The Face"" was found on Mars in the region Cydonia, many people were shocked, especially the public! Many people think that ""The Face"" is real, although the images resemble landforms here on Earth, the images show it is a landform, and scientists have checked the image and conclude that it is just another landform. This is why the face on Mars is just a natural landform.

Have you ever found a small object around your house and wondered; What is this thing? So you compare it to other household objects and find that it resembles something you have. This is exactly what scientists have done with ""The Face"". They weren't sure what it was exactly, but after careful evaluation, they found it looks just like a butte or a mesa- landforms that are found in the American West. This is why ""The Face"" is just a landform, because it is exactly like a bunch of landforms found lots of places. In the text it says, ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This statement shows how the Face is a replica of landforms on Earth, and how it is nothing more than that. These reasons show how the Face is nothing more than a ordinary, dull landform found on Mars.

Imagine this. You are about to look through a microscope to observe a piece of grass. Now without the microscope, you see an ordinary, green weed. However, when you take a look at the grass with a microscope, you can see all of the cells, and pigments, and structures that make the grass appear the way it does. Scientists have taken these exact steps in order to classify the Face for what it is, which is a landform. The images show the face is just a natural landform. Without a careful evaluation, the image looks like a real face. Likewise, when scientists went and examined the Face with a careful observation, they found that the shadows, and angles, and structures of the landform all made it appear as a face. In the passage it states, ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" This piece from the article stands to show that images prove the Face is a landform. Agree or disagree with me, the proof is in the pudding.

I know many people who want to point out others flaws, yet are blind to their own. I know any people who strut around boasting how wise, glorious, and flat-out amazing they are, but have nothing to show for all of their talk. I am sure you know atleast one person like this: we all do. However, when a rocket scientist tells you a picture of a Face is a landform, and has proof to back it up, chances are you will agree with them because you know they are wise and capable of finding the right answer. This is why the Face is just a landform, not only can scientists walk the walk, but they can talk the talk! They have evidence that shows the Face is a landform, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument afterall."" Stements like this can be believed becasue they are coming from intelligent people who know what they are talking about.

Whereas I know that the Face is just a landform, many people think ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" While I can agree that a huge discovery like this might want to be kept a secret for a while in order to figure out what the next step would be, why would you not trust somebody who has an enormous amount of intelligence? Are you a rocket scientist? No. So why doubt one when they tell you that they have examined the Face and found it is nothing more than a landform?

The Face on Mars is a natural landform. Scientists have compareed it to other landforms on Earth, checked the images which show it is a landform, and scientists all agree that it is, in fact, a natural landform. Many people want to keep their hope alive by suggesting NASA wants to keep the actual evidence a secret, but at the end of the day, who know more? You or a Rocket Scientist? I think we both know the answer. Now, we might find aliens in the future, but for now we are yet to have any company in Space.           ",6
e046c43,"While the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto talks in great depth about the science behind how we make certain expressions and what a computer can do with that, the author does not mention what is really causing these emotions, whether it is happiness, anger, or disgust. However, the truth behind emotions like these is human interaction. Without it, a person might not feel anger or sadness, but they might not also feel happiness or joy. One movie called ""Interstellar"" shows a character who has spent years on a foreign planet without the ability to communicate with any other human being. When he is finally discovered, he mentions the horrible pain and loneliness that stemed from an absence of other people. Technology and robotic machines are being slowly integrated into every part of humans' lives, and perhaps there will be no more need for certain professions to be filled by actual people. While the use of the Facial Action Coding System might prove to help identify emotions, it would not be worthwhile in a classroom because it would require one-on-one interaction with a teacher and even transform the classroom into a robotic impersonal environment.

Even if the program would successfully be able to indetify emotions in a student, it would be near impossible for a teacher, robotic or otherwise, to react to each individual students' feelings. Perhaps the technology of facial recognition will eventually become efficient enough that it can read the emotions of a person in less than a second, but what good can this really do? A teacher only has so much time every day to interact with his or her students, and definitely not enough time to talk in length with each one individually. Dr. Huang, an expert mentioned in the article, tells the reader, ?'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" But what if there is only one student in the back of the class who is confused? The teacher cannot be expected to slow down the whole lesson for this one student and force the rest of the kids into boredom. The only time this might actually make a difference is if the entire class, or almost everyone, was confused and the teacher would then take the time to explain the lesson in greater detail. However, most teachers today already have the ability to read their students' emotions. It is not hard to discern when a full room of high schoolers, for example, needs further clarification. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.'"" However, what he does not mention is the other portion of nonverbal communication: body language. That is, body language outside of facial expressions. A very large portion of the way humans express themselves is through body language such as crossing the arms across the chest, bouncing a leg when he or she is bored, etc. Technology doesn't have the capability to analyze this yet. Perhaps it will someday, but for now, attempting to bring this program into the classroom would be unnecessary and potentially expensive and time-consuming.

Additionally, for this program to be most successful, teachers would likely be gradually phased out and replaced by virtual or robotic instructors, an idea that, while perhaps more efficient, will create an impersonal environment in the classroom. Using this program or not, there is no doubt that many people have speculated about the use of robotic teachers sometime in the not-too-distant future. Even Dr. Huang mentions it in the article when he says, ?'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The use of this program would encourage the replacement of human teachers. However, is this really the best direction to go? If a random student was asked to think back to their favorite class period, it is fairly plausible that they would mention something about an actual teacher. Maybe the teacher participated in a fun activity with the students or told a funny joke. Either way, the experience of interacting with real human teachers is simply irreplacable. The author, Nick D'Alto, later goes on to state, ""Empathy (feeling someone else?s emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person?s facial expressions."" As mentioned in a previous paragraph, human interaction is one of the most significant reasons humans are capable of feeling true emotions. Ask anyone what their best memory is and they are almost certain to mention something with another person whether it be a family member, spouse, or close friend. Empathy, as D'Alto touches on, is essential to feeling emotions with the people around one another. So much of these necessary actions would be taken away once real teachers are replaced by artificial ones. It would take almost all remaining enjoyment out of school and form an environment in classrooms that is lacking feelings and is uninviting.

In summary, integrating the Facial Action Coding System into the classroom is impractical and unnecessary. That is not to say that the program does not have many uses in other areas of the world, but its uses in the classroom are minimal. It would waste time and effort for a result that is not notably helpful. Perhaps the developers should first focus on its other uses such as on a website or in video games instead of in the classroom. Schools do not need programs like this and they will only eliminate the living breathing system that is already in place.",6
e0688dd,"There is a lot contraversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the capmaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have alerady experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic. We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy.

The Elecoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and insentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the elctors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process.

In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more.

Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights.

For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid Run-Off Elections (which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner). However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.

The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system.       ?    ",6
e11d005,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that studying Venus is something that should be done even though it can be very dangerous. The author gives multiple reasons to why we should explore the planet, or learn more about it. However, some people think the dangers of Venus outweigh the benefits of pursuing research on it. The author supports the idea of studying Venus even though it can be very dangerous. He provides many details, and facts as to why it's a good idea.

First off, the author tells what Venus is like. He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system."". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.

Next, the author gives possible ways to study Venus safely, and effciently. The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.

Last, the author gives more ways Venus can be studied safely using different technology. While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, ""...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks..."". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus.

In conclusion, it is important Venus is continued to be studied and researched. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a great job of conveying to his audience why studying Venus is important even though it is dangerous. In the last paragraph, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value..."". Studying Venus can help advance many things, and our knowledge of other planets could grow from this as well. There have been many safe ways found to study Venus, so it should be done. The author also states that, ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". This quote also shows that the author believes the study of Venus should continue even though it can be dangerous. If we didn't study things just because they're dangerous, then we would have nothing dicovered. The author of this article believes the study of Venus should continue, and does very well at conveying that by telling the audience Earth and Venus are a lot alike, gives new, safer ways to study Venus, and gives examples of technology that could also make the study of Venus a lot safer and easier.",6
e2f5624,"Classrooms in this time period are filled with high-tech computers and new innovations that are useful to teachers and students. It seems like every month something new is added to classrooms that can help stimulate learning. Some of these new inventions are something that no one would of ever imagined. That's what makes them so appealing and why people grab them off shelves the first chance they can. This technology, you can't quite grab off the shelves, but it is something that is worth installing. This new software, Facial Action Coding System(FACS), relys on facial muscles to identify what emotions someone is feeling. One can only imagine all the different possibilities someone could have with this software, but a major possibility is installing it in classrooms. This technology would be useful to have in classrooms because it can advance learning, prevent bullying, and help identify mental disorders.

There are countless times, when one starts to daze and daydream instead of paying attention in the classroom. Daydreaming is just so much better then having a teacher talk about spectator ions and how iconic compounds can be net or not.

However, this new technology,FACS, could be very useful in the classroom for this reason. The reason being is that it can advance learning like we never would of thought. This computer would have the ability to stimulate lessons that would keep kids enterained and focused. In turn, they would be more likely to learn more and retain the knowledge. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored""(D'Alto). If this computer sensed that the child was becoming unfocused, it could do something about it, unlike teachers who sometimes don't always catch when a student is falling asleep or daydreaming. However, this computer would know and it could fix the issue right away so the child would be learning throughout the day. Since the computer keeps the child focused and learning for a longer amount of time, the child would have the ability to become more intelligent because it would be spending more time learning. This could lead to all different sorts of opportunities for the child, like special education programs, scholarships, etc.

Bullying is a serious issue. It can sometimes be hard to spot and to solve, and no matter how hard people try, it never goes away. It's always there in the hallways of some schools, lurking over some and haunting them. Yet, what if there was a way to reduce bullying in a big way? Well, now there is with the help the FACS. FACS could reduce bullying because it would be able to identify if, for an extended period of time, a child was feeling sad and/or scared. Then a teacher would know something is up. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions...""(D'Alto). Since this software can recognize mixed emtions, it would be able to tell if a child was showing the side effects of being bullied. By recognizing that if a child is being bullied, would help the child because they could talk to an adult and hopefully the problem would be solved. Also, if bullies knew that this software was in schools, then they would be less likely to bully because there would be a greater likeliness of them being caught. Overall, lower levels of bullying would result in higher self-esteem and confidence which then can be reflected in acedemics.

Everyday kids walk through the halls of school and feel like they are totally alone in how they feel. They feel like they will have to live the rest of their lives feeling the way they do, and they become hopeless. This effects their acedemics because they are less focused and might not care how they do in school. However, if FACS was installed in schools, maybe kids could get the help they need. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking on her face""(D'Alto). In some cases, this quote might be true. However, when it comes to having a mental disorder, most friends can't just guess how their friend is feeling. This is where FACS would come into play. This system would be able to know how a child is feeling and then, if those emotions are typically out of the range of what a normal teenager might be feeling, they could be sent to a professional. This professional could then diagnose the teenager whose been feeling this way and possibly have therapy. Overall, they would help them so they will feel better. After all this is done, and the teenager starts feeling better and being able to focus on school, their acedemics could skyrocket.

With all the new inventions and innovations that have been becoming known to society throughout the years, FACS is one of them that could have a postive affect on the public and, more specifically, classrooms. This technology would have the ability to advance learning by sensing when a child is losing interest and then change the lesson to keep them entertained and continue learning. It could also prevent bullying by knowing when a child has been feeling a certain way for a long time, and then other mearures could be taken to help the child. Lastly, this technology could help children with mental disorders figure out why they feel the way they do and educate them about it, while also helping them not to feel that way anymore. Overall, this technology belongs in the classroom because it could solve problems that end up helping teenagers acedemics and result in opportunities to advance the child further.               ",6
e9831f4,"When limiting car usage the first thing that most everyone thinks of is: ""How would I get from Point A to Point B instead of driving myself in my car? Would I walk, ride a bike, take public transportation, or try and find a new creative approach?"" Limiting car usage is not the end of the world, it is the beginning of a healthy one. Most cars burn gas which cause smog and pollution which is harmful to the enviorment, some people get lazy and end up being so dependent on a vehicle that they will not even consider walking a few blocks to a friend's house for an afternoon lunch, and our own ancestors have gone without a car for centuries on end. So would it really be that much of a struggle to not use a car any and every where that you go? You do not need to never use your car again, you just need to realize that using your vehicle more than needed is harming not just yourself, but everything and everyone you interact with in life.

In Paris, France a partial driving ban was put into effect just before the 'City of Love and Romance' reached record breaking pollution levels. The ban states that: ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following days.""(""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer). However, just because there is a law put into affect does not mean that everyone will abide by it. According to Reuters, an international news agency in London, almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their vehicles impounded because of their reaction to the fines. It is a shame that people are so unwilling to follow one rule for one day which would help the planet and reduce the pollution in their city. According to Duffer, Paris ,typically, has more smog than other European capitals. When Duffer's article was published he states, ""Last week Paris has 147 micrograms of particulate matter(PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Also, in Paris, diesel fuel is used more than gasoline. Diesel engines take more energy to burn the gas which causes more pollution than just normal gasoline. According to Reuters, France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. In France, as a whole, 67 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. In the rest of Western Europe, about 53 percent of vehicles have diesel engines. The smog that is in the air from the burning gas of your vehicle ends up in your lungs. Imgine just sitting in front of the exhaust pipe of your car for a few seconds(do not actually attempt this analogy) it is overwhelming and unbearable. It is harmful to your lungs and the rest of your body. That pollution is coming out of thousands and thousands of other cars and is adding up to the air all around you. You breath that air every day, just like your family and friends as well. In Paris, after the partial driving ban, on Monday the smog cleared up enough for the French party to take away the ban on the odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according to Duffer. If the smog in one of the biggest cities in the world can clear up just a little bit in one day from limiting car usage, imagine how much smog could be prevented if you limit your car usage every day. What if you only used your vehicle when traveling out of town or when you need to transport a large item? You can change your whole enviorment just by deciding to walk or ride the bus to work instead of turning on your vehicle to drive 10 miles down the road.

The law that was put affect in Paris, France does not state that you can never drive your vehicle again, it is just simply asking the citizens to go one day without their vehicle. ""But what if I have to go somewhere such as work, school, or anywhere else that I want?"" Paris is a large city, that much is understood, because it is a large city there is more than just one way of getting from Point A to Point B. One way is public transportation from the city and/or local businesses, like a bus or tram.? According to the BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday as well. So, if you did not want to spend extra money than you had to that would not be a probolem. If you do not like public transportation, or do not prefer it, you can get out for a bit of exercise and ride a bike or even walk. Getting up or leaving maybe an hour or two early so that you can get to your desired destination on time is not that heavy of a price to pay. Also, you are getting exercise out of it which benefits your health. Walking or even riding a bike to work can benefit you in so many ways. If you see someone familiar walking towards you, you have the opportunity to start up a conversation and catch up with how their life is going. As well as this, if you see a small shop or stand that sparks your interest you have easier access to explore inside. If you were driving/riding in a vehicle then you would have to cross traffic, find a parking spot, make sure you grabbed everything that you need, and make sure that it is locked. If you are taking a stroll through town, you already have your needed things, you do not need to cross traffic and find a parking spot, and you do not have to risk accidentally leaving your vehicle unlocked and end up possibly getting robbed. A study discovered by Elisabeth Rosenthal found out that driving by youth decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe this is because young people still have the energy and sense of adventure in them to walk or take a bus somewhere(or they just can not afford it, which in the long run saves them money anyway). Maybe you can learn from the young people that decide to ride a bike or skateboard to work instead of driving a car. Maybe taking public transportation is not as crowded and as much of a hassle as the movies make it seem. Taking public transportation can introduce you to new people with different backgrounds as well. You can meet someone that you might not see as a coworker or a family friend that you have an idea already who they are. Some people are always so busy with every day life that they do not have the time to meet new people and learn new names. With public transportation or deciding to walk instead you have a bigger opportunity to meet someone new. Why not give yourself a healthier lifestyle by walking once a week to work instead of driving? The question still remains, why not?

Limiting your vehicle usage does not limit your options and exposure to the outside world. Having a vehicle is not entirely a bad thing either. Some vehicles are 'eco friendly' and are built so they can help protect the enviorment. Sadly, however, most are not built and designed that way. Driving is so stressful for a person. You have to focus on all of your surroundings, check every blind spot, make sure that all of your fluids are not empty, replacing tires, and so much more. Again, driving is not all bad. Some people enjoy to drive, some say that is relaxes them and gives them time to think because driving is the only 'alone time' that they have. Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

ecfadac,"The concept of aliens is a topic that some of us believe and some of us do not. Whether it has to do with how aliens may have affected how Earth was created or that there are other living organisms on planets other than Earth. Most scientists have used reasonable research to discover that aliens are not real, but yet there are still some scientists that believe they are in fact real. Based on the photos taken of the Face, aliens did not create this structure, it is simply just a natural landform.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft visited Mars and discovered the Face while snatching photos for landing areas for the Viking 2 ship. It looked as though it was the shape of a head, which is why it is known as the Face. This formation was gigantic, measuring almost two miles across. Something so giant couldn't have been formed from aliens, especially if it resembles a head, symbolizing that it may be an imprint of an actual alien. As they studied the photos of the Face, they began to realize how similar its features were to those of a human's face, or this case, what could be an alien. These facial features were then recognized to be just shadows, which adds to the fact that the imprint of a human, or alien face, could not have been formed. A formation this large cannot resemble that of a human, nethertheless an alien.

For twenty-five years, ""The Face of Mars"" was a famous attraction, attracting many people to be interested and cause an even broader range of thoughts about how this landform was created. As more people become engaged in this unusual formation, NASA continued to snap photos of the Face to uncover more information about what it really was and how it was really created. Later on, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took one more picture that had ten times the resolution that the orginal Viking images had. When this picture was viewed by many on a web site, it then revealed that it was, indeed, a natural landform and there was no evidence of aliens, as many people thought. Information from the several images that were taken establish that this structure is a natural landform, and not a creation from aliens.

Even though images proved that the Face was a natural landform and not something created by aliens, there still remained people who didn't believe this concept. At the time the most recent photo was taken, it was winter on the planet, and the Face on Mars was located in an area that consisted of a cloudy region. Those who still believed that aliens created the Face also believed that this area of clouds could have affected the picture that was taken during that time. The scientists claimed that it isn't an easy task to find the Face and capture a decent picture of it when possible, but still yearned to capture another shot to prove that aliens had not created it. So, on a summer day that consisted of no clouds, the team captured another photo with the maximum resolution. Because of the outstanding resoluation of the photo, it then again proved that it was simply anatural landform and that aliens did not play a part in it's creation.

Throughout the journey of discovering whether this creation was formed by aliens or that it was a natural landform the scientists and photos taken proved that there were no aliens. Although somemay still believe that there were aliens, these photos demonstrate real evidence that there was not. Like the scientists said, it was very similar to a landform on Earth, that is created naturally. Because of this discovery of the Face, scientists have been given the chance to explore the realmsof creations on other planets and prove that they cannot be formed by aliens, but simply by the natural occurences that take place on that planet.

eddab2b,"Limiting car usage is a tremendous advantange. Haven't you ever thought why? limiting car usage has its reason why its an advantage. One of the huge reasons is pollution, cars tend to create pollution, congestion, smog and many other harmful things. Source 1-4 mentions useful information of the disadvantage of owning or driving a car. Source number two mentions how cars tends to create alot of pollution, for this reason in Paris they decided to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Nobody would like to live in a place where you have to be breathing dirty, contaminated air and knowing you produced it by your own car when Paris enforced to ban cars for a few days to clear out the global air not many fellow citizens participated about 4,000 citizen were charged with a fine for not following the rule. why would you try to be disobbident when what they are trying to do is help you clear out the global sir so the citizens living in that area dont get sick with any disease and dont harm our earth where we live. The advantage of limiting car usage will be creating less pollution to have a better global air. Cars aren't the only way to get to place to place there is other way to transport for example public tranport like buses, train or even if its not that far walking and itll be a create exercise.

Yes, driving a car could sound great because you get to drive anywhere you want and get to places quicker instead of catching or waiting for a public transport when you need to get somewhere and your in a rush. Cars are a huge hand like a big help because it helps people get from place to place. Also remember that cars arent cheap at all an example is that source number one mentions "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two placesto park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" What this quote is pointing out is that to be able to park a car if you own one it has to be in a specific place and which you have to own and live by there which costs alot of money. Limiting yourself for car usage would make you save up a whole lot of money. Instead of wasting like 40,000 dollars in a parking place for a car and have to be living there you can easily just get on public transport and be able to live where you want. source #1 also mentions "" As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a to move here. when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this also points out the not many people in Germany dont own cars and not owning a car really doesnt bother them because they found better way to get a transport and also believing that Saving up money is a really important thing because when you become independ you have to start paying bills, food, and many other things that wyour parents wont give you anymore so why waste it on gas and car washing instead of just getting somewhere in a easy transport and the money you wouldve been wasting in non-sense now will be saved up for something more useful. thinking about it car limiting is a useful thing finacialy and global reaosns too.

Lastly another advantage of limiting car usage is less congestion the less driving there is the less traffic there will be. Traffic is a big headche to people who try to get to their jobs or certain events on time. Public transportion might ttake long to get there also but its becauise there isnt as much buses because not many people get on public transportion and the less buses there is and more cars who cause traffic the more time it'll take off our time. Source #3 states "" in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams."" Bogota, colombia has a great point doing this event once a year will demonstrate citizen that the less car usage the less traffic jams there with be and it will be more relaxing and calming area to live instead of hearing screaming, beeping and other annoying sounds caused by unpatient people. This event that colombia has done has cause other states to realize that thats a great idea and some tried experminting it in their country.

In conclusion limiting car usage has its great advantages which benefits the citizens living in that area so if it benefits you why not try limiting car usage. Limiting car usage creates less pollution, less traffic jams, and your able to save up your money for something thats actually important. Cars aren't the only way you could get from place to place theres many other options like walking, or riding a public transport theres always an answer to everything. By limiting car usage we create less pollution in the air we breathe and there wil be less harm done to the earth and to the citizens. Always try new things and let limmiting car usage be one of them.    ",6
ede5e1e,"""Let's keep moving forward"". Walt Disney harped at the advancement of entertainment and technology in the world and constantly reminded everyone to keep moving forward in their lives and to keep an open mind with new technology. Just like with some of Diney's crazy inventions one must try the new before denying them. The Facial Action Coding System would be considered one of the new technologies that one must keep an open mind to trying. There are many useful ways that this system could help out masses worldwide. It could help between the language barrier, in courtrooms with lie detectors, and most importantly classrooms. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable and needs to be spread throughout classrooms across the globe.

Students' are very different from one another. That includes their friends, their style, their personal values, and their work in shcool. With this system it will make it extremely easier for teachers to help students' education flow a lot smoother. As said in paragrah 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is beocming confused or bored"". This recognition could allow the computer to modify the lesson without the teacher having to take time out of their busy schedule to do so. It will also benefits students who are scared to approach teachers' with their education problems because they might become embarrassed. By using this method with the Facial Action Coding System graduation rates may increase as well as classroom productivity through the help of the lesson modifications.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System should be widely encourged is it could help a teacher build a better relationship with the students. As said in paragraph 4, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". This means that when any student is having emotional stuggles their teacher could be notified by the system. This would allow the teachers to become more aware of their students' outside lives so that the teacher could help the student if needed. Doing so, a stonger trust factor could be built between the student and teacher creating a more productive classroom all together.

Some may say that this system would be an invasion of privacy for the students, but this is not much different than being able to tell how one feels by just examining their expression by oneself. This system advances the technology of facial examination only. It assists others in being able to distiguish one's feelings at the moment. Going a little deeper in the student's life may actually benefit them more than it would invade on them. The system could allow the students to recieve the help they really need by delving a little deeper than a normal human would be able to.

This system could be seen as an insane new technology that some may be afraid of, but to make progess in the world one must open their mind and accept the new to help millions around the world. The Facial Action Coding System could help a plethora of sutdents and teachers with their relationship and trust as well as the students' educations and also the teachers' careers. This system could be the new big thing in the technological advancement of schools, and it will allow more people to succeed in life and create a better future for everyone surounding them.",6
ef3ba7e,"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Wait, anger and disgust is rising? Happiness is plummeting? What is happening? The answer is that this emotion reading technology, though interesting, could actually have a very negative effect on the people it is used on. Especially in a class room, one of the most influential places on a childs life. Sure, it is cool being able to read Mona Lisa's emotions, but on real students a facial action coding system would be impractical, invasive, and damaging.

Being able to detect other peoples emotions is a scary idea, but even before diving into the effects it could have on the mind, it's physical restraints are just as daunting. In paragraph seven, the article states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Schools are already struggling to keep up with the cost of electronics for thousands of students, and having to get new laptops or computers to implemenet this technology would be extremely expensive and unwise. Especially when many schools have real problems that need to be addressed such as a larger special needs program, or more funding to the band who hasn't gotten new uniforms in twenty years. Then once all this money is invested, what if it does not work. This technology is clearly just starting to develop, and it runs solely on facial muscles. The article tells you how to raise your cheek muscles to show a real smile, surely students would find ways to exploit this and fake emotions, rendering the technology ineffective. Most importantly, schools are a fast paced environment, adding this technology and teaching the students how to use it would waste a lot of time that could have been devoted to learning. The other option would be to implement it and not tell them at all, but that would be a clear invasion of privacy and could get the school in legal and financial trouble.

All of this is assuming the school would even want the technology. It sounds very nifty at a glance, but the idea itself is actually extrememly invasive. Emotions are the secret to what's going on in our brain, all of our deepest thoughts and desires are secretly expressed in our emotions, sometimes very subtley. Kids are very secretive, and would almost certainly not take kindly to having there personal emotions, and by extension, what they are thinking about, out in the open. The author says that this technology in a class room would help recognize when a student becomes ""confused or bored,"" but what about all the other emotions that would come with it: the sadness over a lost loved one, the love a teen is feeling towards their crush. These emotions are deeply personal, and if a child wanted to share them he would tell you. Stealing them away with technology is a clear invasion of privacy.

This type of invasion isn't just unkind, it could, instead of helping, actually damage a students emotional or mental well being. Emotions can be a rollercoaster. Everyone has their own way of handling them , and for some people getting them intensly analyzed is not the answer. In fact, this type of prying could cause students to retract into themself, and lower self confidence. For example, if a teen is always being reminded he is feeling sad, won't that just further his sadness? Then, if students don't want to share their emotions, they may start using their facial muscles to trick the machine into thinking they are feeling a certain way. One of the number one things all psychologists will tell their patients in dealing with emotions is not to cover them up and hide them behind other emotions. Constantly being in a state of hiding with emotions could cause students to snap in a bad way.

The last thing students of any age need is more problems to worry about. Emotions are a large, personal part of anyone's life, and to try and analyze them in a classroom setting would be impractical, invasive, and damaging.",6
f260d4e,"The author supports his arguement quite effectively, though not without any flaws. The author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring Venus, and proper proposals for doing so, however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of Venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it.

The effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing. The author describes how Venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and Venus, as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity. It also states that because Venus is the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"", it is a benefit to inhabit Venus first. This persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research Venus.

The author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing, as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed. The introduction of NASA also builds up this ethos, as to bring the audience to better trust in the author. The examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished, such as the ideas of ""systems that use mechanical parts"" and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph, as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial.

However in contrast with the effective support of the main idea, the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea. Firstly, the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced, and because his proposal for a ""blimp-like vehicle"" is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish, the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical. This does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood, and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions.

Also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of Venus. This is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous Venus is, in direct contrast to what he should be supporting. Because of the logos used to show how dangerous Venus is, like how it has ""temperatures average over 800 degrees"" the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt. Because of the mood of the audience, the audience is also less likely to understand why Venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous.

In conclusion, the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas, in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why Venus is so amazing, and how to explore it, however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity, and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation. If the author had attempted to create a mood that was more beneficial to persuading the audience, the passage would have been extremely effective in persuading the audience of his thesis. ",6
f2640ea,"As the author defends the claim that the exploration of Venus is a ""worthy pursuit,"" I, however, believe that this statement is not proven very efficiently. Although the author refers to NASA and the experiments they've carried out, the information just does not sufficiently back up the statement that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author continuously describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, as well as using terms that convey the assumptions he or she is making based on his or her opinion. Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, so with this information in mind, I believe the author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In order for mankind to study the ""cloud-draped world,"" they would have to undergo much training to even be prepared to come near Venus and its harsh conditions. As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are ""far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are ""not easy, but survivable for humans,"" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near.

In addition to Venus' extreme conditions, the challenge of collecting physical evidence from the planet would be extremely difficult as well. Even though humans could possibly hover 30 miles above the ground level, the texts states that the vast distance would provide only ""limited insight on ground conditions,"" and it would ""[render] standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Along with that, the author admits that ""researchers would not be able to take samples...from a distance."" The challenge that the study provides would simply not be worth the time, money, and risks. If man were to go to extreme lengths to reach within 30 miles of a planet and not be able to collect and evidence or data, it would not be a successful mission if the goal was to obtain new information about the planet.

Moreover, the author's word choice contributes to the idea that his or her claim is not very well supported. When examining the similarities between Earth and Venus, the author uses the word ""probably,"" saying that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The word ""probably"" gives off the impression that the author is making an assumption about the fact that Venus could support life just like Earth based on a common feature between the two planets. It is dangerous to make assumptions about subjects such as this, because it would be very costly if it turned out to be incorrect in the end.

After considering both sides of this controversial claim, I believe the author did not support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Although the author referred to the study being beneficial to man's sense of imagination and innovation, it is simply just too dangerous. The author repeatedly describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, as well as word choice that conveys the assumptions he or she makes based on their own knowledge. Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, and I believe the dangers could be more costly than the knowledge gained through the experience. I believe the author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. ",6
f305dac,"Facial Coding: Valuable or Not

There is a new emotion reader out there, called FACS, short for the Facial Action Coding System. This new application has a bunch of cool features and innovations that can have some pretty practical applications. However, this essay is only focused on one application; is this system beneficial for reading human emotions in a classroom setting? People have mixed feelings about this, but this essay will focus on why this new FACS is not extremely valuable for reading emotional expressions in a classroom setting.

First, what can this new emotion reader do? Well, this thing can read all of the emotions on the face of the Mona Lisa. Not just one or two, but four emotions at once, and balance the percentages for each emotion, to let you know exactly how much of each emotion the person is feeling. This could have some really cool applications, like being able to tell what emotions someone was trying to convey in a drawing, or being able to tell what kinds of things you like or dislike, based off your expressions when you are shown different advertisements. There is so much you can do with this new technology, and there is a lot of uses that it has. However, the things you can do in a school setting are just mediocre.

There is a lot that sounds like cool things you can use this application for in school. In the text it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" The text also says,""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This sounds like a really good thing. However, instead of a computer system having to recognize when a student gets confused or bored, the student can just speak up and say something about it. That is not all, though. The computer system could either, one, misread a student's expression and make the lesson harder to understand or take a lot longer, or two, the student might just start drifting away and thinking about something else that is really confusing, like Einstein's theory of relativity. The computer, in turn, would make the lesson modified when it doesn't need to be, and have so many modifications that the student gets completely lost and doesn't understand anything that is happening in the lesson, just because he or she started to think about something else for a couple of seconds.

Lastly, this facial recognition system could seem like a pretty big invasion of privacy. Do people want everyone to know every single emotion they ever feel? Do they want all their teachers to know that they find what they are talking about boring? No, they do not, at least for the most part. Systems like these are getting pretty close to almost being able to know what someone is thinking, and most people don't want everyone to know what they are thinking about. The text says, ""The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This text says that the system can detect your emotions, but also your mixed emotions. Going back to the Mona Lisa example, the software can track the exact amount of emotions that you have, and the percentages of the emotions that you are feeling. This seems way too much like an invasion of privacy, given that people are giving what their feeling, and all of it too, away to a computer system, that can be tracked or looked at by anyone. Now maybe the system will only give what you are feeling to a teacher, or maybe it will not even do that, and function as a one-on-one learning guide. Even still, their are various ways to get into computer and technological programs, and forcing kids to give away all their emotions just for a possible improved and modified lesson seems like way too much to force someone to do, for that amount of a reward.

So, the FACS could have numerous practical applications for entertainment purposes and other purposes too. However, putting it at use to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom isn't one of them. In conclusion, the use of FACS in a classroom isn't worth the value that comes out of it, as it could have better applications elsewhere, it could glitch out or misread emotions, it could read emotions that the student is feeling about something else rather than the classroom, and finally, an appliclation that can read all of your expressions and convey them to other people is a pretty huge invasion of privacy, and forcing people to use this program is not worth the value of a slightly modified lesson for each individual. In the end, FACS is more useful as an entertainment device rather than having a school setting application. This technolgy has great value in so many areas, but schooling just isn't one of them.",6
f40b5d8,"Trying to detect someones emotions is like playing the game ""Clue"", it's a mystery and very hard to figure out. But what if there was a software that allowed a chance to put the individual infront of a camera and the thought of guessing was no longer an option, because all the answers are sitting on the screen? Professor Thomas Huang from Beckman Institute has created such a software, a software that has the ability to calculate someone's emotions much like in math class. This new software can open doors for the future, and give us new advancements in the classroom, but could it be an end to simply asking if some is okay? Could this be the end to emotional privacy, or simply emotions?

The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has many promising attributes and the ability to open new doors for technology and learning environements in the future. It being able to calculate emotions as easily as math problems, could help us decode a lot of the mystery that is the human mind. The process starts wiht a 3-D computer model of the face, and contains information of all the 44 major muscles in a human face and with the help of psychologists, it can classify six emotions and associate them with movements of facial muscles. This type of technology has the ability to be used in a classroom to watch when a student is getting bored or tired to help the teacher better themselves when teaching. Or maybe even help in real world situations when someone goes in front of a jury, or even during interviews for a job. But how accurate is this new software, and how do we know we can rely on it?

The Facial Action Coding System is seemly flawless with many positive outlooks on what is instore for us in the futrue, but has two big questions sitting on its shoulders. How can we rely on this system? And how do we know that this is even an accurate reading? When thinking about someones emotions, one thinks of the individuals emotions as diverse and extremely different from everyone elses. So how can this software accurately read individual emotions around the world? Dr. Huang says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"", he firmly believes that his new software can identify the most mixed emotions with the use of video imagery and emotion recognition. This however, still does not provide us with a good example of how we can be sure that this is a reliable way to read someones emotions and could potetially ruin human socialization and emotions toward one another.

While this new software may seem like the ""next big thing"", there are many ways that this could potentially ruin the human race. Society right now is circling around the phone, it is how we communicate, have a social life, and figure things out. It is in our way of life and we have adapted to the idea of constantly having a phone at our beck and call. So why not add in another way of relying on technology, but this one can help us figure out someones emotions, since simply asking ""Are you okay?"" is too hard and time consuming. Why not just stick them in front of a camera to have it tell them how they are feeling instead of trying to listen to how they feel and talking with one another. This new Facial Action Coding System has the ability to open many new doors, but it could close the door for human socialization.

The Facial Action Coding System is an advancement in technology and has the abilities to open and grow our future. It had the ability to help out in classroom environments and give more support during other real life situations. But with it can come the destruction of human socialization and emotions and make a total mess of how we interact with each other. While trying to figure out someones emotions is very difficult and challenging, it may be better to stick with such ways rather than completly giving up what makes us human and causing a catastrophe in the human world.

Greetings Mr. Senator,

There is one particular issue that has been boggling my brain recently. It is none other than the electoral college system. Irrational, unfair , and outdated is exactly what the electoral college system is. Isn't the virtues of American's built on foundations such as rationality, equality/fairness, and mobility? The head of the United States government isn't even elected to the standards that we, the American people, hold ourselves to.

Mr Senator, I agree with the clause ""majority rules"" to an extent, with ""winner takes all"" being on the whole other side of the ball park. If Americans had a straight voting system, meaning no electoral college, where simply stated, whichever candidate recieves the most votes wins, the process in which we elect our government head would hold truer to our values. With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The ""winner takes all theory"" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? - down the toliet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college.

Now, if this predicament occurs in near half of our 50 states, a candidate who did not recieve the popular vote will reign triumphant over a candidate who a majority of the American people elected to be their new president. According to, ""The Indefensible College"", by Bradford Plummer, Americans lose out on more than just an acountable vote. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they are certain of having no chance in winning. Logically, candidates only spend their time in the ""swing states"" where they could possibly steal al of that states eleectoral college votes (lines 13-20). Shockingly 17 states didn't see a single candidate during the 2000 election (lines 20-21). We sure did suceed and ignoring hundreds of thousands Americans there.

This neglect isn't the fault of the candidates though. Where shall i place the blame, Mr. Senator? There is no childish, frivilolus blame to be placed. Simply stated, the fault lies in our electoral college system. The candidates are just playing the game of the electoral college. The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. Are you saying that America doesn't have the time to recount votes to ensure the prosperity of the American people. Is that the messege you want to project? It sure isn't coming off well.

The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well. Source 3, ""In Defense to the Electoral College"", even admits that the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president (lines 15-17). Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past.

Mr. Senator, I know you are a sensible man who cares about the people he represents. The people's right to vote matters, yes? Do not be so arrogant as to ignore the people who elected you. May I direct you to the preamble to our constitution? Isn't that the sole foundatio of our government? The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. A win by the popular vote is much more commendable by a landslide victory on false pretences.

Thoughtfully,

f6ccff9,"Within Nick D'Altos article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick helps me view the value of using technology to read ones emotional expressions. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of a student within a classroom or ones facial expressions throughout a painting can help distinguish how one had felt. Technology can be used for many things and now those from the Facial Action Coding System has been using this new technology to read the expression given off of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. D'Alto helps put reasonings behind his new Facial Action COding Sytem by promising applications throughout yourself and throughout those in famous paintings.

When reading Nick's article the numerous questions about the Facial Coding System seemingly had been answered. Within the article many professors from different colleges had been developing different indept ways that humans can communicate with computers to help bring the software to a new level. Nick convinced the readers to fall in liking wiht this software due to tha fact that he persuaded them by stating what the computer does. Nick states that ""the process begings when the computer constructs a 3-D computer mode of the face"" which most likey brought more people into the idea of technology reading emetional expressions (para 3). Nick explains the basics of the technology along with the more indepth features that the computer is able to do considering how rare it is to have a software that can read human facial exoressions. Within th article it explains what the software can do such as ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness"" (para 3). This shows how the technology used can read many different emotions from those. Which persuades those to want to explore more into the software and how it actually serves a purpose.

This piece of software comes with many complex algorithims. The technology used is much more advnaced than your regualr software programs because it has to be able to read human expressions as well as the expressions off of those who have been painted. Within the article Nick gives us simple instructuons that can help us ""encode"" the different emotions we expirence as well as the how this technolgy can help us when figuring it out. Nick's instructions are placed within three steps and those steps are, ""Step one: Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. Step two: Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""crows-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. And finally step three: Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes"" (para 7). These steps can help show how at home you can recieve the basics of the emotional expressions revealed although this software can help you determine the deeper aspects of ones emotions. Nick also states that ""it's all about those muscular action units"" which helps us undertsand that the muscles within our face dtermine a lot about our expressions and with the expressions that we project to those within the situations we are placed in (para 7). Emotional expressions people give off are often hidden and with this new technology software we can dig deeper into one's emotions as well as with those feelings in resemblance to the actions being taken place if it's a historical figure that we are scanning to find out the emtional expression of them.

The background inofrmation on the Facial Action Coding System was breif although its still uprising. Nick explains that the ""new software has been developed [to] [improve] accuracy in precieving the emotions of others"" which has shown many great examples on why this technology is useful (intro para). Within the article Nick explains how the software works but he also mentions who has been working on the software and how much knowledge that has been put into this software. Nick says that ""the software is the latest innovation from professor Thomas Huang,.. working in collaboration with professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam"" which helps us understand who had been putting in the knowledge of this software invention (para 1). Although professor Huang and professor Sebe were known as the starters of the inovvation, many of their colleagues had helped then and still help them brain storm better ideas and ways for their software.

After reading Nick's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students and those in paintings such as the Mona Lisa is very vaulable. What makes it valuable to me is the fact that it's hard to read the emotional expressions of those in life and those who have major aspects of today's history. Those who have made history and are nonliving to this day we can put this technology to use and help determine theire emotions thorughout images and it can help us discover deeper into the person themselves as well as the time period in history.

f72239d,"Have you ever experienced a whirlwind of emotions during a dull class? It can truly be a difficult experience attempting to explain to your teacher that you need time out from class in order to orient your mind back onto the subject at hand. With a new technology developed called FACS, or Facial Action Coding System, conveying problems to a teacher isn't difficult when that teacher can already read their students' faces. This innovation, created by Prof. Thomas Huang, can detect the emotions of humans through psychology and 3D computer models that track all 44 major muslces in the human a human visage. In a classroom, The use of FACS is undeniably valuable because it can set apart a real smile from a fake smile, understand the basic human emotions need to be identified in a classroom setting, and it could provide an easier learning environment for students with social issues.

Setting apart a real smile versus a fake smile can provide value in the way a teacher interacts with their student. These feelings are understood with the help of psychology from Dr Paul Eckman. The FACS aparatus uses 6 basic human emotions that can inevitably seperate a real smile versus a fake smile. As it states in the article, ""These muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Therefore, in a classroom setting, differintiating real vs fake can be valuable when a student isn't being truthful about their dog eating their homework. It can also decrease the amount of anxiety a student recieves when asked if they understand a subject, in front of the class. If a teacher can understand their emotions, it would facilitate having to step aside with the student and talk about their difficulties on a particular subject. Understanding the difference between a faux emotion and a real one can make a difference in the realm of teaching, just as understanding the six basic emotions can too.

Using psychology, the teacher can also understand the six basic emotions needed to understand in a classroom setting. With the help of psychologist Dr Paul Eckman, the emotions read by FACS are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Happiness and surprise are emotions most of us can read, therefore its understanding through the FACS machine isn't vital to be understood. Other emotions like anger can be important though. Identifying anger on the face of a student can keep other students safe by isolating the student from the others, which in turn could keep everyone safe from a potential rage-induced tantrum. It can also help knowing berforehand if a student is sensing dangerous emotions such as anger, fear and/or sadness. According to paragraph 9, ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" If a teacher knows some of her students are feeling any of the three previous emotions, producing a happy environment could help keep the students happy or bring their emotions to a higher level of happiness. It therefore is valuable in that aspect and also to students thank can have issues with talking to their teacher.

Just as identifying dangerous emotions is important, so is identifying uncomfortable situations that can therefore be easier for socially anxious students. According to Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The former of those two emotions is vital to be identified because it can help teacher know when their students don't truly understand a lesson. Often, socially anxious students tend to keep their quesitons to themselves when they are confused about a topic out of fear of being juged as dumb or incompetent. They will go on without understanding which in turn can cause a decrease in their grades. If a teacher is able to read the true expression of their student, these type of situations can be avoided in order to create a better teaching experience for all the students.

In conclusion, FACS is without a doubt a valuable asset in a classroom environment because of its ability to identify real from fake, its understanding of the basic human emotions needed to be comprehended in a class, and because it facilitates learning for students with a fear of speaking.

In the future, seeing this innovation in a class setting would be an amazing feat for a step towards smarter teaching. With the help of Prof. Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman, a new future can be created. ",6
f86b855,"Emotions are a vital part of human life. Although they are sometimes overlooked or seem to not be present simply by looking at someone's face, they are used every day. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" introduces information regarding a technology which is able to detect the most common emotions. While this invention is widely seen as incredible, if not revolutionary, the Facial Action Coding System's presence is not valuable in classrooms.

The Facial Action Coding System does not have much value when it comes to using this technology to read students' emotinal expressions. The technology itself, while advanced in certain ways, is not that much more effective than a teacher's or students's abiltiy to distinguish feelings. The author, in his article presenting the many positives of this technology, addresses the idea that the system is able, from a 3D model it has built, to analyze the msucles of the face, matching their activity to certain basic emotions. The technology's ability to recognize emotions based on facial features and human behavior is something that humans have been doing automatically for centuries. The specific muscle structure is not necessary to determining one's feelings, as their use show noticeable changes on the face and are visible to the naked eye. Although this might be quicker, the technology would not have much value for classroom situations, as teachers could easily, while paying more attention to their students, notice the same details, identify changes in emotion, and alter their ways of teaching accordingly. Overall, the human's ability to identify basic emotional expressions would render this technology rather unvaluable in classrooms.

Similarly, the purely scientific origin of the Facial Action Coding System decreases the value this technological innovation would have for students in a classroom. While it might be successful in identifying the emotions of students, the Facial Action Coding System relies purely on the muscle behavior and structure, as mentioned in the article, meaning that no other factors would be taken into consideration. Many factors other than emotion, such as fatigue, can alter a student's appearance or behavior. The coding system would most likely, as a result of these underlying factors, as well as the very limited amount of emotions it can perceive, make the technolgy unvaluable when comes times to read student's emotional expressions. The generalization of emotions detected would produce false or unaccurate results, rendering the program useless in classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System, due to its computerized nature and lack of human perception, would not be a valuable addition to classrooms.

The lack of privacy this new technology brings makes the invention unvaluable. While some may think this to be a good way to improve student's lives throughout the school day, this facial recognition would raise many questions and controversy regarding student privacy. As the author states in the article, the Facial Action Coding System could be implemented in computers with the purpose of regulating ads and personalizing them to someone's preferences, likes, and dislikes. This is not only unnecessary, but would mean having a constant stream of visual information regarding students being sorted and analyzed. If this were implemented in classrooms, a number of parents and students alike would find this to be an intrusion of privacy, resulting in complaints, debates and overall unnecessary problems added to the education system. While this innovation might be somewhat useful or bring more attention to student's feelings, the excessive problems and controversy it would create makes the student emotional expression detector technology unvaluable and not a good addition to school.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The technology, although it could properly analyze the muscles and facial structure of students in classrooms, could easily be matched by a teacher, does not take in all possible factors, and would conjure up many questions regarding privacy in schools. While this program would have little to no value in classes, it could provide help to investigative work. Emotions are extremely versatile and human expressions, although they share some similarities, widely vary based off of each person and circumstance.",6
fa9b6e1,"Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the ""Mona Lisa"". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. The use of this technology to read the expressions of students in a learning envionement can help students learn more efffectivly by allowing for immediate feedback from a student allowing for the quick shift of a lesson plan, and being able to help and support students emotionally.

This technology can help get immediate feedback from students. In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms.

To continue, the FACS technology would help students be more emotionally stable. While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached.

While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways. However, while some arguements may be warranted, many are based off of falsehoods. To begin, emotion can be understood on a scientific level. Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

In conclusion, the ability to read the actual emotion and reactions of students in class rooms is extremely valuable because it allows for greater understanding and excitment of a subject, along with the ability to help students be emotionally stable. If this technology is implemented into schools, studnets will overall do better, feel better and make a brighter world for tomorrow. FACS is something revolutionary that hopefully all of us can learn somthing from.",6
